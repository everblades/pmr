Thinking About Medical School?

Thinking about going to medical school and becoming a doctor but not sure if it’s for you?  Here we’ll explore what it takes to become a doctor and how you can make the decision to pursue a career in medicine.

The Path

Medicine can be an extremely rewarding career choice, but just what does it take?  It’s a long path, that’s for sure.  You’ll need to spend 4 years in college to earn a bachelor’s degree.  Then you’ll be in medical school for 4 more years.  After, you’ll spend 3-7 years in residency depending on which specialty you choose.  Many students choose to further specialize by spending 1-3 more years in a fellowship.  Overall, you’ll spend at least 11 years in training between college, medical school, and residency training.  And some specialties can require as many as 14 years.

Medical school is notoriously expensive – many medical students graduate with over $100,000 in debt.  Many students also report that medical school was the most academically challenging 4 years of their life.  Once you reach residency you will start to receive a salary, but it will be very modest compared to the average pay of physicians in your field.  You can also expect to work extremely hard during these years.  Many residents work 80 hour weeks and spend countless nights and weekends in the hospital.

How to Decide

As you can see, it is a long and hard path to become a doctor.  None of the above was meant to scare you away from medicine, but it is important to know what you’re getting into.

Most people who go into medicine like helping people.  It’s cliché, but true.  If you think about it though, there are tons of ways to help people: You can become a teacher, lawyer, or customer service representative just to name a few.  So why do people choose medicine in particular?  The biggest reason is the special relationship between a doctor and her patient.  The patients trust their doctor with their most precious possession: their health.  Patients often come with personal or private problems that they share with their doctor and trust her to fix.  Many doctors also enjoy learning the science and applying it to help others.  These are just a few of the ways medicine is different from many other professions.

Some people love doing this kind of work and others don’t.  So how do you know if it’s right for you?  Get experience in the field!  Many doctors are willing to let pre med students shadow them, all you have to do is ask.  Find a doctor in a field you’re interested in and ask if they would let you follow them around for a few days.  When you’re with the doctor, ask plenty of questions.  Ask what their typical day is like, why they went into medicine, if they have any regrets, etc.  Notice the doctor’s interactions with patients and ask if you could see yourself doing the same thing.  If you didn’t like the experience, reflect on whether it was something about that particular field you didn’t like or if it’s medicine as a whole.

Is It Too Early to Start?

Medical schools will not be reviewing your high school transcript when you apply for admission. However, your college grades will be extremely important and you can start preparing for college now!

High School Courses for Medical School

You’ll want to have a strong background in the sciences, so try to enroll in as many science courses as possible. Some particularly high yield courses include biology, chemistry, physics, and statistics.  These courses will be among the most important you will take as a pre med student, so it helps to have a strong background before you even start.  If your school offers AP or IB courses in these subjects, you should strongly consider taking them.  If your high school offers dual enrollment, you can also consider that, but remember the grades you earn in your dual enrollment classes will stay on your permanent record and will affect your GPA when applying to medical school.  Therefore, be very careful when choosing dual enrollment courses and be sure to get very high grades in these courses.  You can review all of the requirements for getting into medical school here.  Start preparing yourself now by enrolling in equivalent high school classes so you have a background in those subjects.

Pre-med

Your main goal in your high school years, however, should be finding and getting into the right pre med college for you.  In order to get into the pre med degree program of your choice, you’ll need to have the right combination of SAT/ACT score, GPA, volunteering, and activities.  Luckily we’re here to help!  You can find our complete guide to getting into a top pre med college here.  The only time a medical school will look at your high school transcript is if you are applying to a combined BS/MD program.

For help with college admissions and exams, check out Kaplan’s options for the PSAT, SAT & ACT. Here is our recommended course: Kaplan College Prep Advantage- Unlimited Prep for PSAT, SAT & ACT!

Finding Pre Med Colleges

While it is true that you can get into medical school with almost any major from almost any college, the vast majority of students enrolling in medical school chose a pre med major tract.  Most major universities have a specified tract for pre med students.  You can check their websites for specific details, as programs vary widely from school to school.  Below is a guide to what to look for when choosing between pre med colleges.

How to Choose a Pre Med College

You can choose any major in college as long as you cover the medical school admission requirements, so look for a school with majors you’re interested in!  The basic prerequisites for medical school (and the MCAT) require you to take a full year of General Chemistry, a full year of Organic Chemistry, a full year of Biology, and a full year of Physics.  Some medical school course requirements are more comprehensive and may require a semester of Biochemistry and a semester of Statistics.  Regardless of your major, you must take these courses to get into medical school, so it is important to look for a college with a strong reputation in these areas.

Most colleges will offer these courses, and most with strong pre med degree programs will have a great reputation in these sciences.  So how do you further narrow down your search?  The best way is to look for colleges that offer unique extracurricular activities.  For example, does the college have any clubs or organizations for pre med students?  Often these organizations have special opportunities for their members, such as shadowing opportunities or volunteer programs.  Look for their websites and research what they offer.  If you already know what medical schools you might like to attend, check their websites and see what undergraduate pre med programs their students attended.

A final option for choosing a pre med degree program includes looking into a seven year medical program.  These are exclusive programs offered by many colleges that allow you to get your bachelor’s degree and your medical degree in seven years.  Read more about seven year medical school programs here.

Best Undergraduate Schools For Pre Med

There is no ranking system for pre med colleges!  Instead of focusing on going to the “best” pre med program, you should use the reasoning above to choose the right college for you.  You will be working hard during your pre med courses and you will be much better off going to a school where you are happy and comfortable.  If you absolutely must make a ranking of the best pre med schools, here is a general guide.

The best pre med colleges often are attached to strong medical schools.  This is because the school will generally have a strong science faculty and lots of research activity (which means opportunities for you to get involved).  Search google for the most current ranking of medical schools.  It is also useful to note that the Ivy League schools are generally considered good pre med schools and have a long history of placing students in medical schools.

About Seven Year Medical Programs

Seven year medical programs (also called BS/MD programs) are special degree options offered by some colleges that allow you to get your bachelor’s degree and your MD in only seven years, instead of the normal eight.  They usually offer guaranteed admission to medical school after your third year of college, provided you maintain certain academic standards.  You then complete the normal four years of medical school and those medical school courses apply toward both your bachelor’s degree and your MD.

Many people apply for these programs and they have become quite competitive recently due to the huge advantage of a guaranteed medical school acceptance.  If you apply to one of these programs, be sure to have a strong GPA and standardized test scores.  You may also have to write essays about your interest in medicine and attend an interview.  Many times, the same guidelines for applying to medical school can be used for applying to seven year programs.  See our medical school personal statement guide and medical school interview guide for more information.  The application process for seven year medical programs is significantly more difficult than a normal undergraduate program, but the reward is considerable – guaranteed acceptance to medical school and finishing a year early (saving time and money).

These programs are not for everyone.  You must be prepared to work hard – you will be completing your prerequisites for medical school admission in three years instead of four!  You should not apply to seven year medical programs if you are not sure you want to be a doctor.  If you have any doubt, enrolling in a normal pre med program and taking time to do shadowing and volunteering is a better option.

Colleges that Offer Seven Year Medical School Programs

Page.create(title: "Medical School Requirements", body: "Medical School Requirements: General

Medical school admissions can be a tricky process.  Medical School requirements can vary from school to school, so it’s always a great idea check with each individual school you plan on applying to for specifics.  However, there are general minimum requirements that every med school looks for.  That’s what we’ll cover in this section.  For more information about the exact scores it takes to get in visit our admissions statistics page.

This is our recommended book for medical school admissions: The MedEdits Guide to Medical School Admissions: Practical Advice for Applicants and their Parents
Medical School Requirements: Courses

This is a general list that every school requires.  These courses will also be helpful for the MCAT:

General Chemistry + Lab (1 year)
Organic Chemistry + Lab (1 year)
Biology + Lab (1 year)
Physics + Lab (1 year)
English (1 year)
These are courses that some schools may require in addition to the above:
Biochemistry + Lab
Calculus
Statistics
Social Sciences
It wouldn’t be a bad idea to try to take as many of the courses on the second list as possible, even if the schools you’re applying to don’t require them.  They look good on your transcript and they set you apart from other applicants.


MCAT

The MCAT is one of the most important medical school requirements and it is mandatory to take for every US medical school.  You should try to take it before you plan on applying to medical school in case you need to take it more than once.  There is no magic score that will guarantee you acceptance to medical school, but you should try to aim for a 30 or above to make yourself a highly competitive applicant.  We have seen a few students admitted to medical school with MCAT scores around 25, but they are generally the exception.  See our MCAT Prep Guide page for more details.

GPA

GPA is another one of the most important medical school requirements.  So, what GPA do you need to get into medical school?  This is a common question with no correct answer.  Obviously the higher your GPA, the better your chances, but people with lower GPAs have also been accepted to medical school.  To be considered competitive, your GPA should be at least 3.3 and a GPA of 3.6 or above is considered good enough for most medical schools.  To be considered for admission to most schools, you should have at least a 3.0 GPA.  If your GPA is low, you’ll need to balance it out with a higher MCAT score and stronger extracurricular activities, such as those listed below.  See our statistics page for current data on accepted students and their GPA/MCAT scores.

Shadowing

Shadowing is not one of the mandatory medical school requirements.  However, it is extremely important to shadow as much as possible for several reasons.  Shadowing will help you decide for sure that you want to be a doctor.  It will give you some insight into what a real, average day is like for a person in that specialty.  Shadowing will also add considerable value to your medical school application.  Not only will the admissions team be impressed that you took the time to shadow doctors, but they will know that you know what it’s like to actually be a doctor.  You will have something to talk about in your activities section of your application and you might have something to talk about in your personal statement.  We’ve never seen a student accepted to medical school who didn’t complete shadowing.

It’s best to approach a doctor you’d like to shadow in person.  Tell them you’re a pre med student and you need shadowing before you can apply for medical school.  Most will be happy to help.  You might also find doctors to shadow from personal connections or through your school’s pre med organizations.  While you’re shadowing, pay attention to your surroundings and what’s happening around you.  Is the doctor communication with patients well?  Are the patients going home happy?  Does the doctor love his job?  What can you learn from this experience?  These are all potential points to use in your personal statement.

Volunteering

This is another area that is not necessarily required, but will help to set you apart.  Volunteering of all kinds is helpful, but volunteering in medical settings is especially useful.  You can use your experiences while volunteering to add substance to your personal statement.  The quality of the volunteering experience will also matter to medical schools.  It is more meaningful to dedicate longer periods of time to projects that you’re passionate about than to just attend a one day event.

Research

Research experience is not required to get into medical school.  However, it can also be helpful to strengthen your application.  If you go to a college with lots of research activity it shouldn’t be hard to find a research mentor.  Approach your favorite professors and ask about opportunities.  They may have openings in their own lab or they might know someone else willing to take on an undergrad.  Additionally, you can search your school’s current research projects online and email professors who are working on projects you’re interested in.  Research can be a useful topic to add to your activities on your application, especially if you have the opportunity to present at a conference.

Leadership

This is an additional section that’s not required but looks awfully good.  Medical students and doctors are often leaders that their community looks up to, so gaining leadership experience is valuable.  This often takes the form of officers in student organizations.  If you can show commitment to a student organization and gain enough trust to earn a leadership position, medical school admissions officers will be impressed.  It will also give you something to talk about on your application.  For example, maybe you believe healthcare should be delivered as a team and you learned how to work together through your experience as an officer.

Medical School Requirements: What Should I Focus On?

The most important part of your application will be GPA and MCAT score.  Focus on these as much as possible and try to mix in extracurricular activities when you can.  However, you should never sacrifice grades to focus on extracurriculars.")

Page.create(title: "Pre Med Major And Courses", body: "Pre Med Major and Courses

What is the best pre med major?  What pre med classes should you take to fulfill the pre reqs for med school?  Should I take my pre med classes online?  You’ll find the answers to these questions and more below!

Pre Med Major in College

There are only a few classes required for medical school, so it is not completely necessary to have a pre med major, or even to major in science!  Instead, you should follow your passions and interests.  Medical schools are increasingly looking to diversify their classes by accepting students from a wide variety of college majors and besides, this might be your last opportunity to study something besides science for a long time!  The best pre med major is the one that you’re interested in most.  If that’s biology, great!  If that’s economics, great!  Don’t think you have to major in science to go to med school, it just isn’t true!

Pre Med Classes to Take to Fulfill the Pre Reqs for Med School

Regardless of your major, there are several classes to take to fulfill the prerequisites for med school.  All medical schools will be looking to see that you completed the following courses:

General Chemistry + Lab (1 year)
Organic Chemistry + Lab (1 year)
Biology + Lab (1 year)
Physics + Lab (1 year)
English (1 year)
These courses will also be very helpful for your MCAT exam.  After that, most medical schools don’t have any further course requirements!  Some schools may require you to take Biochemistry (1 semester), Statistics, Calculus, or some Social Sciences.  If you have some free time in your schedule, explore!  Medical schools will love to see a well-rounded applicant with a wide variety of interests.  Look here for a more complete list of medical school requirements.
Pre Med Classes Online

In general, it is a bad idea to take pre med classes online.  While this is not always true, it is no secret that many online courses are a waste of time and you don’t learn much from them.  Medical schools will want to see you complete a rigorous schedule of coursework in the classroom so they know that you are capable.  In fact, a few medical schools now require that you take all of your prerequisites for medical school in a physical classroom.  It is perfectly fine to take a few electives online, but you should avoid taking your main prerequisites online at all costs.

Pre Med Classes at Community College

Community colleges can be an excellent place to take pre-med classes for many students.  It may be convenient to take classes at a local college while you’re home for the summer.  Community colleges are often less expensive than universities and they might offer courses that better fit your schedule.  These are all great reasons to look into community college courses.

However, you should be aware of a few things before you sign up.  Most importantly, you should check with your current school to make sure the credits will transfer without any problems.  Your school might also require you to take a certain number of your core classes on campus and not at another college.  Make sure to look into these issues as you don’t want to take a course only to receive no credit.  Many students sign up for community college courses because they think the classes will be easier.  This is not necessarily true and is never a legitimate reason to sign up for a community college course.  Pre-med courses are difficult and you will have to work hard anywhere you take them.

How to Prepare for the MCAT

mcat prep student
Below we’ll cover everything you need to know about MCAT prep.

What is the MCAT?

The Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) is an exam for college students considering attending medical school administered by the AAMC.  The MCAT was designed to give medical schools an idea of which students are most likely to succeed in medical school.  The test is given several times a year on the computer at certified MCAT testing centers nationwide.

The MCAT currently consists of four sections tested in this order:

Physical Sciences – 52 questions, 70 minutes
Verbal Reasoning – 40 questions, 60 minutes
Writing Sample – 2 essays, 60 minutes total
Biological Sciences – 52 questions, 70 minutes
As you can see, this is a long and intense exam that covers a wide variety of subjects.  Physical Sciences consists of General Chemistry and Physics.  Biological Sciences consists of Biology and Organic Chemistry.  Click here for more about the Writing section.


***The MCAT is changing!  The new format has been approved and will be administered starting in 2015.  See the bottom of this page for information on changes to the MCAT.


The maximum score on each of the science and verbal sections of the MCAT is 15, for a total maximum score of 45.  The writing sample is scored on a separate scale.  There is no magic number you need on the MCAT to get accepted to medical school, but you should aim for a score of at least 30.  The writing sample score is generally considered unimportant for medical admissions (and this section will actually be removed in 2015).  Students have been accepted to medical schools across the country with very low writing scores.
When Should You Take the MCAT?

You should take the MCAT only after you have completed the courses that the exam covers:

1 year of General Chemistry
1 year of Organic Chemistry

We also recommend taking the MCAT before you apply to medical school.  This will give you time to re-take the exam if you don’t get the score you want.  You should allow at least 10 weeks to prepare for the MCAT before you take the exam.  You should visit aamc.org to see all dates and locations the MCAT is offered.  We highly recommend registering for your desired date very early because space is limited and often fills up months in advance!
How Should I Study for the MCAT?

This is the million dollar question.  Literally.  Studies have shown that 70-80% of students take an MCAT prep course before their exam and MCAT preparation is a huge industry.  We would like to offer you a bit of a different perspective (since our goal is to help you and not to promote an MCAT test prep company).

You can self-study for the MCAT!  You should allow yourself about 10 weeks to be able to adequately cover all of the material.  There is a wealth of free MCAT material available online both through google and youtube.  Search these places!  There are also several low-cost MCAT prep books available online or at your favorite bookstore.  You should use a prep book to review the material that the MCAT covers and study practice questions.  We recommend our favorite materials on the Resources page.

You should also take several full-length practice exams as part of your study plan.  Spread these out over the course of your studying – ideally you would take one full-length practice MCAT per week for 10 weeks.  You can register and take one free, full-length MCAT at e-mcat.com.  This is the only place you can buy real, previously administered MCAT exams.  Your first few practice exams should be used to gauge your timing and comfort with the testing system.  Your score will probably be erratic since you haven’t covered all of your study material yet – this is okay!  Your scores should start to normalize toward your final few practice exams.  The final exams will give you a good idea of where you’re likely to score on the real test, as well as what your strong and weak subjects are so you can tailor your study plan.  You can find more information on our recommended practice exams in the Resources section of this website.

MCAT Courses

If you’re the type of person that needs structure and interaction with an instructor, a live MCAT class might be a good option for you.  Almost every test prep company offers a live MCAT course and they are usually offered several times per year.  Some companies also offer an MCAT online class and private MCAT tutoring.  The online MCAT course is a good option for those who need the structure, but don’t have time to attend a class or don’t live in an area where a live MCAT course is offered.  You can find info on our recommended MCAT live and online courses on the Resources page.

Changes to the 2015 MCAT

As of May 2012, the AAMC has approved changes to the MCAT starting in 2015.  The new MCAT exam will include the following sections:

Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems – 65 questions, 95 minutes
Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems – 65 questions, 95 minutes
Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior – 65 questions, 95 minutes
Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills – 60 questions, 90 minutes
The most obvious changes are the addition of the Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section and the removal of the Writing Sample section.  According to the AAMC, this new section will test your knowledge and use of concepts in psychology, sociology, biology, research methods, and statistics to provide a background for your study of the sociocultural determinants of health in medical school.

This seems to imply that students will now need to complete courses in Psychology, Sociology, Statistics, and some Biochemistry as part of their MCAT preparation.  We recommend that all students planning on taking the MCAT in 2015 and beyond include these courses in your schedule plans.  More information on the 2015 changes to the MCAT can be found here: AAMC MCAT prep.")

MCAT Writing

Tons of pre med students have questions about the MCAT writing section essays.  What should I write about?  How should I structure my essays?  How can I write a quality essay in 30 minutes?  Does my score even really matter?  That’s what we’ll discuss below.  Click here for more details about MCAT prep.

About the MCAT Writing

The writing section is one of the most mysterious sections of the MCAT.  There’s not a whole lot of information about it out there and many MCAT review books only cover it briefly.  The writing section comes after the Verbal Reasoning section and before Biological Sciences.  You’ll have 60 minutes to respond to 2 essay topics.  You can spend as much time on each as you want, but you only have 60 minutes total, so we recommend spending about 30 minutes on each essay.  You’ll be given a philosophical statement to respond to for each essay.  You will be instructed to write about what you think the statement means, an example of when the statement is incorrect, and a determination of when the statement is correct and when it is wrong.

Does My MCAT Writing Score Matter?

How is the MCAT writing sample scored anyway?  Your essays will be read and given a numeric score by a group of readers.  Your numeric score is then converted to a letter score between J and T.  The letter is what shows up on your score report.  Recent data from the AAMC (as of May 2012) confirms that the writing score generally doesn’t matter much in medical school admissions.  As long as you don’t completely bomb this section, it won’t have an effect on your application, so don’t spend too much time studying for it.  From experience, we have known plenty of students in the L-O range that have gotten into medical school and we’ve never heard of a student being questioned about their MCAT writing sample score.  In fact, the AAMC is removing the writing section from the MCAT completely starting in 2013.

How to Write an Essay

The readers understand that you’re under a time crunch and expect to see a few mistakes in every essay.  You do not need to write a polished, professional essay to do well.  It is the content that matters more than anything.  Make sure you respond to all 3 parts of the prompt (what does the statement mean, when is it wrong, how can we determine when it’s wrong and when it’s right).  We would recommend spending a paragraph addressing each part of the prompt.  For example real-life prompts, click here: MCAT Writing Prompts.")

Medical School Personal Statement Step By Step

About the Medical School Personal Statement

Your personal statement is a crucial part of your medical school application.  This is the first chance an admissions officer has to get a glimpse into who you are beyond your MCAT score and GPA.  You want your personality to shine through and you want to show them you are more than a good test taker, you are a good person.  Now more than ever, medical schools are taking personality and leadership traits into account when making decisions.  The medical school personal statement is your place to stand out and you’ll only have 5300 characters, including spaces.  So how can you possibly write an essay that captures your personality and character in such a short space?  Find some tips below.  You can also view a medical school personal statement example here.

Here’s our recommended book for medical school personal statements: Medical School Essays that Made a Difference, 3rd Edition (Graduate School Admissions Guides)
How to Write a Captivating Medical School Personal Statement

Brainstorm

You’ll want to answer questions in your personal statement that wouldn’t appear elsewhere on your application.  Here are some examples of what you’ll want to include:

Why do you want to become a doctor?
What motivates you to study medicine and help patients?
What experiences (good or bad) have you had in the medical field?
What personality traits do you have that will make you successful?
Why are you unique from other applicants?
What hardships have you overcome in your life?
Why did your grades fluctuate over your college career?
You may have great answers for some of these questions and you might not have thought about others before.  This is the time to brainstorm your ideas and write them down.

Main Theme

Most effective personal statements don’t ramble on and on jumping from one topic to another.  Instead, they center their statement around one central theme.  Many choose to use a personal experience in medicine or a story as their theme.  Some people choose to write about a medical mission trip that they went on or perhaps a hardship they’ve overcome.  From your brainstorming, you might have a few ideas about your main theme.  At this point, you should pick a theme and start connecting how your brainstormed ideas fit into your theme.

Confused?  Here’s an example: Suppose you chose to write about your medical mission trip as your main theme.  Also suppose that your brainstormed ideas were that you’re hard-working and persistent, you’ve had many good and bad experiences shadowing doctors, and you want to be a doctor because you love science and people.  What you should do now is try to think of a time during that trip when you worked hard and were persistent.  Try to think of a time when you shadowed doctors who weren’t good and contrast that time to the doctors you encountered on your trip.  Also, think of a time on your trip that’s a great example of your love for science and people.  This will be the basic framework for your personal statement!

Now Write!

Now that you have a basic outline of the topics for your personal statement, it’s time to write!  You should keep a few things in mind while writing that we’ll mention now.

The AMCAS application does not have a spelling or grammar check!  You should write your personal statement in an outside program and make certain there are no errors.  Nothing brings down a good personal statement like a careless spelling mistake.

Don’t worry about being like everyone else.  Let’s face it, nearly everyone wants to go into medicine because they want to help people.  You don’t need to come up with some incredible new reason to go into medicine, you just need to be sincere about what you say.

Your intro should be interesting!  Think of a way to make your reader interested in what you have to say.  For example, instead of saying “In the summer of 2010 I went on a medical mission trip to Haiti.” you could say “I found my passion for medicine in the place I least expected: the sweltering summer heat of Haiti.”  See how the second sentence draws the reader in?  This is your goal – to make the admissions counselor interested in learning more about you.

You need to have good transitions.  One way to bring down a great personal statement is to make it feel disjointed by not using proper transitions.

Don’t use cliché adjectives to describe yourself.  Please don’t say “I would make a good doctor because I’m intellectual, kind, caring, and hard-working.”  Show it instead!  Telling a story that shows those qualities about you is a much more effective way of making an impression.

Include details that won’t be found elsewhere on your application.  Talk about hardships you’ve overcome, your unique experiences, and show your personality.  If you’ve had fluctuations in grades, it might be a good idea to explain why in a short paragraph.

That’s it!  You should be well on your way toward crafting an interesting and sincere personal statement.  Still confused?  You can find an example of a student who used our methods to write a real personal statement that worked here.

Medical School Personal Statement Feedback

Seek out as many people as possible to edit your personal statement and give you feedback, this can be very helpful in your writing process.

There are many services that offer medical school personal statement editing and feedback. We offer a service to provide feedback about your personal statement, but we will not edit or write it for you. For more information, use the contact form.")

Medical School Personal Statement Example Text:

The clinical trial had not worked, and there was nothing more that could be done, the oncologist said. My grandpa had been diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in November of 2006 and this latest development was devastating news for my family. For seven months my family often questioned and second-guessed the oncologist’s erratic treatment plan, which didn’t seem to make any sense. The doctor never gave my grandpa any options; instead, he dictated how the treatment would proceed. My grandpa had been taken off chemotherapy in order to be enrolled in a clinical trial that the oncologist himself was running. The benefits of the clinical trial were unclear and my family felt my grandpa was being enrolled for the sake of the trial and not his own health. Once chemotherapy ended and the trial started, my grandpa’s condition worsened greatly and after the clinical trial ended, the oncologist informed him there was nothing more that could be done, but he had at least six months left to live. The following week Hospice Care came to see my grandpa and told him he had two weeks to live. He died a few days later. At many times during the process I personally became very frustrated with his oncologist and I wished I could have done something to help my grandpa get better.

Looking back on my grandpa’s death, it is hard not to question the motives of the oncologist. While I will never know for sure what actually happened, I can learn from the experience and make sure that none of my future patients go through similar situations. During my shadowing experience with Dr. Smith, I was able to observe many of the qualities I believe physicians should possess. I believe that doctors have a responsibility to let the patient decide how he is treated. As a doctor, I would listen to each patient’s concerns and explain all of his options clearly and thoroughly. I would recommend what I felt was the best course of action but ultimately leave the decision to the patient. I would also spend the time necessary to stay current with medical research so I could provide the best care possible. Dr. Smith embodied these characteristics and they were greatly appreciated by his patients, who felt like they were actively involved in the decision-making and healing process.

When I first came to college, I wanted to cure cancer. I had always been fascinated by science and I loved helping others, so cancer research seemed to combine my passions. However, as I progressed in college, I realized there was something about the research atmosphere that was missing for me. When I worked in Dr. Grey’s cancer research lab during the spring of my sophomore year, I enjoyed applying the science but I missed human interaction. That summer, I volunteered in the emergency room of Seattle Grace Hospital and I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

Working with the concierge volunteers, I helped patients out of their cars and into wheelchairs, brought patients to their beds, and helped visitors find their family members. Most patients would arrive miserable, either very sick or injured. I had the opportunity to observe many of their interactions with the doctors and nurses and I realized this is what I want to do with my life. The patients placed their trust in the doctors, and the doctors worked hard to diagnose and treat their problems. When the patients left, they were generally much happier and often they would even thank me for my minimal role in their care. This is the kind of impact I want to make as a doctor. I want to be able to send a patient home knowing I have helped her become healthier and made a positive impact on her life. This is also the impact I wished I could have made on my grandpa.

As a doctor I would also like to make a difference in the lives of those who are disadvantaged. I grew up in an area that was economically disadvantaged and I witnessed first-hand the hardships that this situation presents. My high school was made up of 75% minorities and many of my friends could barely afford gas and only dreamt of receiving proper medical care. Despite the challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed my childhood experiences in my neighborhood and became very interested in learning the culture of recent immigrants and even undocumented families. I came to realize that although they might not have the means to pay, they are hard-working and deserve proper care. Another thing that I noticed was missing is the knowledge of basic preventative care measures. For whatever reason, information about how to prevent disease and basic risk factors did not reach the community. I would like to be able to return to my community, or a similar one, as a doctor and give back to those who are less fortunate by helping them receive proper care and educating them about preventative medicine.

While I have come to realize that curing cancer in a research setting is not for me, many of my underlying goals remain. Rather than working towards a cure in a lab, I want to work toward curing individual patients on a more personal level. During my shadowing experience with Dr. House, I came to understand that a total cure might not be possible for each patient. Nonetheless, I know that as a physician I can make a positive impact on the lives of my patients and that is why I want to go into medicine.

Page.create(title: "Medical School Recommendation Letters", body: "Medical School Recommendation Letters

On this page we’ll talk about the requirements for medical school recommendation letters and how to get quality recommendation letters.

Medical School Recommendation Letters

All medical schools that we’ve heard of require recommendation letters from applicants.  Beside that, the specific requirements vary widely from school to school, although most medical schools prefer to see a committee letter from the student’s undergraduate institution.

A committee letter is actually a package of letters from the student’s institution and includes a cover letter from an official at the school.  Most large undergraduate schools have a process in place for students to request a committee letter.  See your undergraduate advisor for more details.  You may have to submit your personal statement and resume, as well as attend an interview depending on your college.  You will also have to submit a certain number of recommendation letters that will be included in the packet to your school’s committee.

What if your school doesn’t offer a committee letter?  You’ll need to check with each school you plan on applying to in order to find out their specific requirements.  The AMCAS medical school application will allow you print a form to give to your letter writers that has details on how they will upload their letter to the application.  In general, you will need at least one letter from an upper level science faculty member, one letter from a non-science faculty member, and one letter from someone outside of school.  Some medical schools may also require a letter from a peer.

How to Get Medical School Recommendation Letters

Whether your college offers committee letters or not, you will still need to request letters from your professors.  Try to choose professors that you know well and who taught courses that you did well in.  Don’t know any professors well?  Most professors will not turn you down if you go to their office personally and explain that you did well in their class and need a recommendation for medical school.  Research mentors, volunteer coordinators, and club sponsors are also good sources for letters.  If you need a peer letter, try to choose someone who you’ve known for a long time and trust.  Choose someone who knows you personally and academically so they can speak to your personality as well as your work ethic.

You should provide all of your letter writers with a copy of your personal statement and your resume so they can speak about your personality, your commitment to medicine, and your various activities.  You can read more about writing a personal statement for medical school here.

In AMCAS, you will be able to enter information about your letter writers and choose which medical schools receive which letters so you can satisfy each medical school’s requirements.  Read more about AMCAS here.

Template Medical School Recommendation Letters

Many professors and volunteer coordinators are inundated by requests for medical school recommendation letters, especially those who teach large classes or work for large organizations.  For this reason, they often resort to using template letters for the majority of their students.  Medical schools know this and they won’t hold it against you if a couple of your letters read like templates.  However, if you want to really make an impression, seek out letter writers who you know personally and have a long relationship with.  This makes it more likely that they will write unique and insightful medical school recommendation letters about you.")

Page.create(title: "AMCAS Medical School Application", body: "AMCAS Step By Step

AMCAS, the Standard Medical School Application

The American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) is the standard medical school application used by MD schools.  This makes applying for medical school a streamlined process.  All you need to do is finish your AMCAS medical school application and select which schools to send it to.  Once your application is sent, those medical schools will contact you with further requirements and a secondary application with information specific to their school.

AMCAS Timeline

AMCAS follows a similar timeline every application cycle, although the exact dates change from year to year.

June 1st – AMCAS medical school application is available for students to access
July 1st – Medical schools begin to receive completed applications
October 15th – The earliest date a school can accept a regular applicant
November 1st – Last day to submit AMCAS.  Last day for transcripts to arrive at AMCAS
May 15th – Accepted applicants must notify only one school of their intent to matriculate and withdraw from all other schools
We recommend submitting your medical school application as early in the process as possible.  It takes 4-6 weeks for AMCAS to verify your application by checking your course work information after you submit.  Most medical schools use rolling admissions, so you have a great advantage if you apply early!  Below is where you’ll find information about using AMCAS to apply for medical school step by step.

AMCAS Medical School Application Step By Step

You can find the AMCAS application at aamc.org, the same place you went for MCAT registration and scores.  You’ll also use the same login information that you used for the MCAT here.

Identifying Information

This section is pretty self-explanatory.  You’ll enter your name, birthday, social security number, etc.

Schools Attended

Here you’ll enter what schools you’ve attended in your academic career.  You should only enter the high school you graduated from, but be sure to enter ALL colleges you’ve attended.  It will delay your application if you do not include a college you have attended, even if you didn’t earn credit there.

Transcript Requests

This section will allow you to create transcript request forms for all colleges you’ve attended.  You are required to send an official transcript to AMCAS from all colleges you’ve attended.  It would also be a good idea to request unofficial transcripts for your personal use while you fill out the course work section.

Biographical Information

Most of this information is self-explanatory as well.  They will ask you for mailing addresses, citizenship, languages, etc.  One thing to pay attention to is the ‘disadvantaged status’ question.  If you feel that you are disadvantaged for social, economic, or educational reasons, you should click yes and write a good explanation of your situation.  Also, look for the question about felony and misdemeanor convictions.  You must answer this truthfully – most medical schools will conduct background checks to confirm your answers.

Course Work

This is by far the most tedious section of the AMCAS medical school application.  You need to enter all courses you’ve ever enrolled in for college credit into the system.  This includes classes you’ve withdrawn from, grade forgiveness, repeated courses, dual enrollment courses from high school, everything.  You even need to enter courses that you anticipate taking before enrolling in medical school.  You need to enter the courses exactly as they will appear on your transcript – AMCAS will verify every single course with your transcripts and discrepancies will cause delays.  This is where having an extra copy of your transcripts will come in handy.

Work/Activities

In this section you’ll have an opportunity to explain all of your extracurricular activities.  This is often an overlooked section of the application, but you should carefully craft your answers.  You’ll first want to write all of the necessary details about your activity (dates, hours, contact, etc).  Next you’ll get 700 characters to describe the experience – use them wisely!  You’ll want to give a general description of what the activity was and what you did.  This is where most people will stop.  Your application will be much more valuable if you also include how the experience influenced your interest in medicine.  For example, you can enter a shadowing experience with a doctor you didn’t particularly like.  In the description talk about why you didn’t like that doctor’s approach to medicine, and what you would do differently.  This shows the admissions committee that this experience was valuable and you learned something from it, making you a stronger overall applicant.

Letters of Evaluation

This is where you’ll enter information about where your letters of recommendation will be coming from.  You can enter up to 10 letters of recommendation into AMCAS (note: a committee letter packet will only count as 1 letter even though it contains multiple letters).  AMCAS will then let you target which medical schools receive which letters.

Medical Schools

This is where you’ll decide which schools you’ll be applying to.  You can always add additional schools after you’ve submitted your application, but you cannot remove schools you’ve already sent your AMCAS application to.  This is also where you can designate which letters of recommendation will be received by which schools. Read more about letters of recommendation.

Essay

When AMCAS says ‘essay’ they are actually referring to your personal statement.  You have 5300 characters to write about yourself.  The AMCAS application does not have a spell check, so we recommend writing your statement in an outside program and pasting it here.  If you are applying to an MD/PhD program, you will need to answer 2 additional essay questions.  Read more about writing a captivating personal statement here.

Standardized Tests

This is where you’ll enter your MCAT and any other standardized testing info.  The vast majority of students only need MCAT information and since MCAT is integrated with AMCAS, it should already be there for you!  You can enter additional tests such as GRE, GMAT, or LSAT if you’re applying to a dual degree program such as MD/JD, MD/PhD, or MD/MBA.

AMCAS Medical School Application Certification and Submission

That’s it, you’re all done!  All that’s left is to read the statements carefully and submit your application!  Soon after you submit your application, you’ll receive secondary applications from the medical schools you’ve applied to.  Read more about writing secondary application essays here.

Here we’ll discuss the medical school secondary application and how to write impressive secondary application essays.

What is a Medical School Secondary Application?

One you submit your primary AMCAS application (read more about AMCAS here), you’ll start receiving secondary applications from the medical school’s you’ve applied to.  Most secondary applications consist of a few essay questions.  Secondary applications are the medical school’s way of requesting more information from you that is specific to their school.  Therefore, you should research the medical school sending you the application and tailor your responses to that school.  You should try to submit your secondary applications as quickly as you can once you receive them, so let’s get started!

How to Write an Effective Secondary Application Essay

Since the essay questions vary so much from school to school, it is nearly impossible to give specific advice on writing an essay response.  However, many of the same rules of writing a personal statement apply to secondary application essays (read more about personal statements here).  The difference is you should tailor your responses to the individual medical school you are applying to.

Do your research!  Is the school focused on research or primary care (or a mix)?  What is the curriculum like?  What hospitals is the school affiliated with?  What does their match list look like?  Is it a newer school or is it rich in tradition?  Does the school have any special interests, such as serving the elderly?  These are all things you should be asking yourself when writing your responses.  Among the most important things you can do on a secondary application is convincing the admissions staff that you’ve done your research and that you’ll actually attend the school if accepted.  This means you must use these essays to convince them that your values are in line with theirs.  If you can do this effectively, you have a good chance of landing an interview.

The Bottom Line on Medical School Secondary Application Essays

Medical school secondary applications are a constant struggle because of the sheer volume and time constraints you’re under.  Our best advice is to complete the essays as soon as you possibly can once you receive them.  Try to make the time to write them quickly yet thoughtfully and without sacrificing quality under the time limit.")

Page.create(title: "Medical School Interview", body: "Medical School Interview Guide

So, you’ve received a medical school interview invitation?  Congrats!  On this page we’ll cover how you should prepare for your interview and what you should expect on interview day.

Preparing for a Medical School Interview

The first thing you should do is research the school where you’ll be interviewing.  You should have already done this when writing your secondary application.  You want to get a good idea of what’s important to the school.  Is it focused on research?  Primary care?  The underserved?  Does the school have any special programs or a unique curriculum?  These are excellent things to keep in mind for possible talking points during your interview.  You should also think of a few things you can ask the interviewer about the school.

Next you should find out what types of questions the school’s interviewers normally ask.  You can find feedback from students who previously interviewed at the school here: Medical School Interview Feedback.  Some schools are notorious for asking certain types of questions, such as ethical questions.  Also find out whether the school normally has conversational interviews or if they’re more high-stress.  Many schools will ask you about things that you wrote on your application.  Be sure to review your AMCAS application and your secondaries before your interview day to refresh your memory on what you wrote.

Once you have all of this information compiled, you should practice answering questions that you think will likely be asked.  Have a friend or family member sit down with you and simulate a medical school interview.  Their feedback on your answers can be very valuable and with practice you will be much more comfortable and confident on your actual interview day.  Many large colleges offer mock interviews through their Career Services office.  Find out if your school offers this service and ask if you can set up an appointment.

Finally, you need to have professional clothes to wear for your medical school interview day.  If you don’t have any, purchase some in advance or make a reservation for a rental.

Medical School Interview Day

Dress professionally and arrive early.  Get to the interview location around 15 minutes early so you have plenty of time to check in.  You don’t want to be late as it leaves a bad first impression.

Every school has a different format for their interview day, but it generally includes information about the school, a campus tour, lunch, and the interviews.  Most schools have 2 interviews with a faculty member.  Some schools might have a 4th year student interviewing in place of one of the faculty members.

Try not to have your interview answers sound scripted or rehearsed.  This makes you look fake.  You want to do your best to have a normal, flowing conversation with the interviewer.  Ask a few questions that are relevant to the school so the interviewer knows you’ve researched the school and you are truly interested in going there.

After Your Medical School Interview

Many schools will give you the contact information of your interviewers.  If you feel comfortable, send them a quick thank you note after the interview.  This is not mandatory but it’s a nice gesture.")

Page.create(title: "How To Choose A Medical School", body: "How to Choose a Medical School

So, you’ve been accepted to multiple medical schools.  First of all, congratulations!! That is an amazing accomplishment.  Second, how do you choose which medical school you’ll attend?  We’ll attempt to answer that question here.

Choosing the Best Medical School

Everyone wants to go to the best medical schools.  But, how do you define the best medical school?  Sure, there are plenty of rankings of medical schools out there, but what are they based on?  Mostly research funding and admissions statistics.  What if you’re not interested in research and you don’t care about what MCAT score your classmates achieved?  We believe that choosing the best medical school means looking beyond the rankings and finding the right school for you.

Things to Consider

There are several factors you should consider when choosing the right medical school for you and academic prestige is just one part of the equation.  Here are some other factors to consider:

Medical school grading system – There are several grading systems that exist.  The most common are pass/fail and honors/pass/fail.  Some medical schools rank their students and some schools don’t.  Everyone has a different view on how medical school grading should work.  Research your schools and find the grading system that you like most.
Medical Student Research Opportunities – Want to do research as a medical student to position yourself for a competitive residency?  Or would you rather go to a primary-care focused medical school?  Some schools are known as medical research powerhouses and some choose to focus on other areas.  Find the best fit for you.
The Medical Students – While you visited the school for your interview, how well did you get along with the medical students?  Could you see yourself fitting in as a part of their class?  These are the people you’ll be spending the next four years of your life with and you’ll need friends in a stressful environment, so this stuff does matter.  Did the students get along with one another?  Was there a note sharing service and study groups?  Or did you get a sense that it was a competitive environment?  Some medical schools create an environment where the students get along like a big family, promoting well-being and collaboration.  Other schools harbor more competitive environments.  This may sound harsh, but competition often encourages studying and produces well-prepared students.  Find the best environment for you.
The Clinical Opportunities – What hospitals is the medical school affiliated with?  Where do medical students generally do their rotations?  What is the reputation of these hospitals?  Check Health Grades.  Would you rather learn in a large, urban hospital with opportunities to see a wide variety of cases or a smaller hospital where you might get a more personal education?
Opportunities for the Future – Does the school offer residency programs?  Do these programs seem to favor their own students?  What does the medical school’s match list look like?  Do many students match into a specialty that you’re considering?  Do the students match into prestigious hospitals or programs?
Financial Considerations – You’re going to be in debt, but how much?  It’s easy to lose track of money when your loans are sky-high, but there is a considerable difference between a $30k loan and a $40k loan.  It’s irresponsible to think otherwise.  Take responsibility for your future and take cost of attendance and financial aid into account.
Overall Feel – Sometimes it’s hard to describe, but you just know where you belong.  Did you get a special feeling during interview day?  Could you see yourself studying at this school?  Living in this city?  If the school offers a second look day, attend it.  If they don’t, call the school to set up a visit and get your questions answered – they’ll be very happy to help an accepted student.")

Reapplying to Medical School

I was not accepted to MD school the first time, now what?  Should I consider reapplying to medical school?  Should I research osteopathic medical school?  Should I research Caribbean medical school?  We’ll answer all these and more below.

Reapplying to Medical School – Why Wasn’t I Accepted the First Time?

The first thing you should consider when deciding whether reapplying to medical school is a good idea is why you weren’t accepted on the first try.  Did you receive an interview to medical school?  Were you wait listed for medical school?  These are indications that you were close to getting in and it is worth trying again.  Maybe your MCAT score was just a little too low or your GPA was just a tad off.  Or maybe your extracurricular activities weren’t quite strong enough.  You should have a pretty good idea of why you didn’t get in and you need to work on that area before you reapply.  DO NOT reapply to medical school without strengthening your application.  The med schools will want to know what you did in the year between application cycles and how you strengthened yourself as a candidate.

If your MCAT score was a little low (usually below 27-28), you should use the extra year to study hard and retake the test to improve your score.  If it was your GPA, you should work on raising that number.  Take more undergrad courses (particularly in the sciences) and do well.  If that isn’t an option, consider doing a one year medical masters certificate program.  Many major universities offer this option.  If the problem was your extracurriculars, work on getting volunteer hours and shadowing experiences.

Our Opinion on Reapplying to Medical School

If you have determined that you weren’t close to getting accepted the first time, it may be time to consider other options.  The two most popular options for students looking for alternatives to MD school are osteopathic medical schools and Caribbean medical schools.

Osteopathic Medical Schools

See our complete guide to osteopathic medical schools here.  If you decide reapplying to medical school isn’t for you, consider osteopathy as an additional option.  Osteopathic medical schools are four-year medical schools in the US that allow you to earn a DO degree.  Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are full, recognized doctors that can practice in the US.  The osteopathic medical schools teach a different philosophy and approach to medicine and they are generally less competitive and easier to get into than allopathic medical schools.  Doctors of osteopathic medicine go to residency programs in the US, although they are generally less competitive applicants.  As a result, most doctors of osteopathic medicine practice in an area of primary care, such as family medicine or pediatrics.  You can start your research into osteopathic medical schools by finding our list of accredited osteopathic medical schools here.

Caribbean Medical Schools

See our complete guide to Caribbean medical schools here.  If reapplying to medical school isn’t right for you, consider applying to medical school in the Caribbean.  Caribbean medical schools are a popular option for students considering alternatives to US MD schools. These are four-year medical schools located in Caribbean islands that allow students to achieve an MD degree that is recognized in the United States.  Some Caribbean medical schools even allow students to do their clinical rotations in the US.  Caribbean medical students may attend residency programs in the United States, although they are generally considered less competitive applicants than US MD students.  Therefore, it is important to research the top Caribbean medical schools and find Caribbean medical school rankings since you’ll want to attend the best Caribbean medical school you possibly can.  Updated rankings can all be found on google.  It is extremely important that you make sure the Caribbean medical school you choose is accredited. You can find our list of accredited Caribbean medical schools here.

Page.create(title: "Caribbean Medical Schools", body: "About Caribbean Medical Schools

Caribbean Medical Schools

Caribbean medical schools can be a great option for students going into medicine.  They are generally less expensive than American schools and usually less competitive.  Additionally, most Caribbean medical schools accept students to start medical school 3 different times of the year.  And some don’t even require you to take the MCAT!

Negatives to Caribbean Medical Schools

Sounds good right?  Don’t hop on an airplane just yet.  There are a few negatives to Caribbean medical schools that are important to consider.  The first is accreditation.  It is extremely important to attend a medical school that is properly accredited, but since these schools are outside the US, they aren’t accredited by American authorities.  In addition, there are 4 states (CA, FL, NJ, NY) that evaluate medical schools in the Caribbean on an individual basis and most schools are not accredited by all 4 states.  Bottom line – research every single school you plan on applying to and find out how it is accredited.  We have done some research ourselves and compiled a list of accredited Caribbean medical schools for you to research further.  But don’t take our word for it, do your research before you apply – we cannot stress this enough!  You do not want to attend 4 years of medical school only for your degree not to be valid in the US.

You should also know that your clinical opportunities may be limited by your choice of medical school.  Some Caribbean schools send their students to US hospitals to gain clinical experience (note: as of May, 2012 this practice of paying American hospitals to have their students train there has attracted some controversy).  However, the Caribbean students may not get as much experience as American MD students, especially if they are located at the same hospital.  You should research where each Caribbean school sends its students for clinical rotations.

Caribbean medical students are also at a disadvantage when applying for residency programs in the US.  Recent match data published by the AAMC shows that in some cases American MD students with lower USMLE scores are still more likely to get a residency spot than Caribbean MD students.  You can find the data here.

Our Opinion on Caribbean Medical Schools

We’ve listed a few negatives to attending medical school in the Caribbean.  However, none of this was meant to discourage you from applying.  Going to the Caribbean can be a great option for many students.  We simply would like to encourage you to do your research and choose a school wisely.")

Page.create(title: "List Of Accredited Medical Schools", body: "List of Accredited Caribbean Medical Schools

The following is a list of accredited Caribbean medical schools that have been accredited by organizations that the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA) of the US Department of Education has deemed comparable to the standards of the LCME, the association that accredits American MD schools.  This list is accurate as of May 2012.  Due to the changing standards of accreditation and the changing accrediting bodies for Caribbean medical schools, it is highly recommended that you further research all schools listed here.

Page.create(title: "Osteopathic Medical Schools And What Is Osteopathy", body: "About Osteopathic Medical Schools

Osteopathic Medical Schools

Most of this website has been devoted to getting into allopathic (MD) medical school.  However, you should know that there is another fantastic option when it comes to practicing medicine – attending osteopathic medical schools and becoming a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO).  So what is a DO anyway, and how do they differ from MDs?

What is Osteopathy and How is it Taught in Osteopathic Medical Schools?

According to the Cecil Textbook of Medicine, there is almost no difference in the medical training for osteopathic medical schools and allopathic medical schools in the United States.  The only distinguishable difference is that DO schools teach Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment.  This is a technique in which the doctor uses his hands to manipulate the patient’s body to prevent or treat some disease process.  This therapy goes along naturally with the osteopathic belief system that the whole body is connected and its structure relates to function.  This is the only major way that osteopathy differs from allopathic medicine.

There are fewer DO schools in the US than allopathic schools, therefore the majority of doctors in the US are MDs.  In general, osteopathic schools are less competitive to get into than MD schools and graduates of DO schools are considered less competitive applicants for residency programs.  Therefore, many DOs end up in less competitive specialties such as family medicine and emergency medicine.  Please be aware that these are very generalized statements and you should research every school that you are interested in attending.

Our Opinion on Osteopathy and Osteopathic Medical Schools

Osteopathy and Osteopathic medicine is a great option for anyone who wants to practice medicine, but is looking for an alternative to the MD degree.  It is especially useful for those who want to become a doctor but wish to complete their training in the United States (as opposed to the Caribbean).  However, you should research the match list of every school you plan on applying to so you can gauge how tough it is to match into your specialty of choice.

Post.create(title: '5 Reasons Social Media Good Pre Meds', body: 'By: Roheet Kakaday

After allowing The Biopsy public exposure and starting a Twitter account for it, I learned one important thing – I wish had done so sooner. The digital age of medicine is upon us and shaping a beneficial online presence is going to be one of the most critical activities a physician can undertake. Physicians, whether they like it or not, will have a de facto online presence due to doctor rating websites. As Dr. Vartabedian so aptly said, “Google is the new CV.”

So what can you, the budding premed, do to grapple with the ever-expanding digital domain? Instead of deleting your social media presence online in a mad rush to cover your tracks during the application season, you could use social media to your advantage. Danielle Jones, at Mind On Medicine, has covered this question in regards to residency interviews, but the concept is applicable to premeds as well. By cultivating a meaningful social media presence, you can impress medical schools and create another substantive activity on your résumé. Here are five reasons why I think every premed should have an online persona:

1. You learn new ideas fast.

Ideas move at the speed of the Twitterverse, which may or may not be faster than the speed of light. Once you’ve connected with other people, your Twitterfeed gets flooded with good ideas, on which you can build new concepts, contrast existing ones, and reflect on your opinions.

Once I started my Twitter account and followed notable movers-and-shakers in the online medical sphere (@AAMCtoday, @drmikesevilla, @kevinmd, just to name a few), I kept receiving more tweets than I knew what to do with. By plugging into this network you’ll start hearing the rumbling of new concepts – concepts that could change medicine’s future – well before anyone else does.

2. It creates dialogue.

Dialogue is part and parcel of an online media presence. If you want to be heard you need to speak up, in 140 characters that is. Twitter is teeming with users debating new ideas that may be applicable to you. Get in on that! Medicine is all about communication so it seems fitting that the internet be a medium of such communication. When you’re debating or agreeing with someone on Facebook Twitter, or your blog, you’ll be participating in valuable dialogue that’s beneficial for all parties.

3. It helps develop your bearings in medicine.

What are you most interested in? Emergency medicine? Medical education? Health information technologies? Have no idea at all? Well that’s okay too. By monitoring Twitter debates, following other medical personas, or reading responses to your blog posts, you’ll get a better picture of what you’re interested in and what you may or may not have a semblance of expertise in. Why is that important? By honing in on what you’re curious about, you’ll develop a stronger sense of what your interests are. That will make your premed path much easier and more focused.

Let’s say Billy is a premed who likes primary care and computers. When he was 14, Billy built his own computer and coded his own applications. In college, Billy started an online persona and found himself contributing to debates in primary care and computers. Reading the responses in both arenas, he found himself drawn towards #HIT (Health Information Technology) more so than #FMRevolution (Family Medicine Revolution) tweets on Twitter. Because of this, Billy went on to develop meaningful opinions about electronic health records and even coded his own health-related mobile app. Billy now has something awesome to put on his medical school application.

Don’t worry if you don’t find your bearings quickly. I’ve been at it for a short while now and I’m still interested in everything! Sooner or later, though, I assume everyone will find their niche.

4. You’ll mature more quickly.

Medical schools are highly concerned with recruiting mature individuals. Once you’ve amassed a modest following on the internet, you’re sure to find people who challenge your ideas. I was initially afraid of this, but it actually is a good thing. You’ll be forced to reflect on your ideas, sometimes even modify them, but don’t think of this as somehow reflecting poorly on you. We premeds are still young and our perspectives are still developing. By exposing your ideas to the public, you’ll be, in a sense, smelting them into stronger convictions indicative of maturation.

In response to the feedback you receive on your thoughts, you’ll become more wary of what you publish on the blogosphere or Twitterverse. Dr. Vertabedian posted an interesting piece on online physician image and its juxtaposition with the traditional clean-cut physician image. Online, we are who we fashion ourselves to be. Thus, if you’re interested in maintaining a professional online persona, you’ll start thinking more professionally. The posts you develop will be more thought out and nuanced. In medicine, physicians always have to be deliberate and cautious with the words they use. By developing a professional online persona, you’ll already have practice in that art, which puts you one step ahead of the competition.

5. You can easily contribute meaningfully.

Unlike research, which takes months, if not years, to come up with valuable results, social media runs on instant gratification. You can contribute meaningfully through various platforms and have instant feedback on how you’re doing. During research conferences, where you need to be someone to be heard, all you need in Twitter handle to start sharing ideas. That’s your ticket to jumping in on dialogue and contributing your opinions to the masses. What other avenue is so easily accessible in medicine?

Of course, this is all assuming you’re not an inflammatory individual who tries to provoke incendiary comments. Rational and calm debate is the best way to get ideas across. Furthermore, it’s important that you maintain HIPAA compliance by changing names, genders, locations, or any other kind of identifying information. If you follow these rules, you’re golden.

Post.create(title: 'Medical School Early Decision', body: 'What Should I Consider About the Medical School Early Decision Program?

The medical school early decision process is much different from college early decision.  When applying to college, you can apply to one school early decision and also submit normal applications to any other college you’d like.  With medical school, if you choose to apply early decision, you cannot apply to any other medical schools until you receive a decision from your early decision school.

Most medical schools offer interview invitations and admission decisions on a rolling basis.  Therefore, your chances are much better if you apply early in the process.  Students who want to have the absolute best chance at admission often submit their applications before August.  However, if you apply early decision, you might not hear back from the school until October.  If you are not accepted, this can leave you in a mad scramble to apply to other schools.  You will have tons of secondary applications to fill out and even if you finish them quickly, your application will still arrive late in the process and you will be at a disadvantage compared to those who submitted early.

Our Advice on Medical School Early Decision

For this reason, we almost never recommend the medical school early decision program.  For the vast majority of students, it is simply not worth the risk.  You would be much better off applying early to a broad range of schools.

There are a couple of cases where early decision might be beneficial.  For example, if you have your heart set on one particular school and would never go anywhere else.  If you are only applying to one school and will only consider attending that one school, early decision would be the way to go.  The program might also be beneficial for elite applicants.  For example, if you are sure you want to go to school X and your statistics are well above that school’s averages, go ahead and apply early.  If for some reason you aren’t accepted, you might still have a good chance applying to other schools late because of your high statistics.

Overall, while the early decision program sounds like a good idea in theory, its negatives far outweigh the positives for the majority of applicants.  If you are thinking about applying early decision, please keep this in mind.

Post.create(title: 'Medical Student Question Jess', body: 'The following question was submitted by one of our readers on our Ask a Medical Student page.  Head over there to read what medical school is like and to ask a question of your own!

“Chris! It is great to hear that there is an opportunity for some fun time. If you could go back to your undergraduate years and tell yourself three things, what would they be? My school lacks premedical help, so I mostly have to look online for information and resources. Thanks for the feedback”

Here’s the response:

“Thanks for the question!  Hopefully you’ve been able to find some good resources online for getting into medical school.  I would probably tell myself the following:

1. Slow down!  Going into medicine is scary for many people because of the amount of time required until you’re finally able to practice.  This made me want to finish undergrad as quickly as I could so I could finish med school as young as possible.  Let me tell you, there are plenty of older students in medical school and they have no regrets.  I think the average age of the incoming class of my school is around 24-25 every year and quite a few students are around 30.  There’s nothing wrong with taking your time getting to med school and enjoying life!

2. Don’t believe everything you hear.  This one probably especially applies to you since you need the internet for information.  There are so many opinions out there about what it takes to get into medical school and medicine.  Take them with a grain of salt and do the research yourself.  Check out official statistics and contact the schools’ admissions offices if necessary.  I remember reading on some forum that I would never get into a certain school without at least a 35 on the MCAT.  I looked up the stats for that school and the average score was a 31.  That means many people who got even below 30 got in!

3. Get into great habits.  I’m not talking about studying here, because if you can get into medical school you probably don’t need advice on how to study.  I’m talking about exercise, eating healthy, and hobbies.  It’s really important to get into these things before you start medical school.  Once you start school, you’ll have less free time and it will be really easy to get into bad habits if you don’t already have good ones.

I hope that helps, thanks again for the question!”', excerpt:"Title", user_id:1)

Top 10 Medical Legal Cases That Every Medical Student Should Know About, and What You Can Learn From Them

By: Niqui Stubbs

As a fresher at a new university you are under a lot of pressure; pressure to make friends, pressure to do well in a new environment, and pressure to indulge in fresher’s week to the point of substituting meals for alcohol whilst trying not a complete fool in front of your intimidating new tutor. Being a university student is scary enough, but as a medical student you are under more pressure than any other student, and as a medical student myself I know this better than anyone (no matter what your mathematician flatmate tries to tell you, maths is not going to help him save the world, or any lives.) You will hear many horror stories of junior doctors, and even well trained consultants getting sued for medical negligence because of something they failed to do or something they did wrong. Many of these will not be true, thankfully, and are simply there to scare you, but there are a significant number of them that are. Dwelling on them at such an early stage is neither practical nor healthy! It is good, however, to learn about what doctors have done wrong in the past so you can be aware of ‘what not to do’ by the time you start your hospital placements, which for some of you is as early as first year.



Rule Number 1- Make Sure the Patient is Fully Informed

   Bolam Vs Friern hospital management committee (1957) Do not disregard this case because of its age; it is one of the most important you will ever read. Bolam was a mentally ill patient who agreed to undergo electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) as part of his treatment. Unfortunately, he was not made fully aware of the risks of this procedure, most notably the risk of fractures if the body was not properly restrained and muscle relaxants not used. As a result of the patient not being fully informed he was not able to request the muscle relaxants and body restrains, and the treatment resulted in him suffering from a broken hip. Bolam put in a claim for negligence, and lost on the grounds that he was merely misinformed of his treatment, not actually treated with negligence.

One of the reasons why this case is so important is that it brought about the term ‘standard of a responsible body of medical men’ meaning that if a case is brought against someone in a particular profession, in this case that of medicine, then the outcome of the case depends on whether the standard of care was at the level, or below the level that would have been given by others in your profession if they were in the same situation. If it is considered below that of the ‘responsible body of medical men’ then a claim of negligence may be given.

It is common sense that you should inform your patient of the risks of ANY procedure, even the small ones, so do not forget the little things. They may stop you from being sued by a very angry, misinformed patient!



   Chester Vs Afshar (2005) Miss Chester was a woman who was referred to a neurologist regarding back pain. The said neurologist told the patient that surgery was the solution, and likely the cure; he failed to inform her of the 1-2% chance of complications. Any doctor should know that even the smallest procedures carry risks, and one as big as surgery (especially SPINAL surgery) is going to have some chance of complications, be it that of blood loss or infection as is common in any surgery, or one more specific to spinal nerve damage.  As it happens, Miss Chester left the theatre with cauda equina syndrome (a syndrome which will soon be drummed into your head as it can lead to permanent paraplegia, sexual dysfunction and both urinal and faecal incontinence) having had no prior knowledge of any risks.

The case is not about whether the patient would have undergone complications regardless of the attending surgeon, because it is likely that she would have done; again it is about a doctor failing to fully inform a patient. If Miss Chester had been aware of the risks she may have chosen not to undergo the surgery and may not now be suffering with such a terrible condition. On the other hand, because the chances of a complication were so small, the patient may have chosen to disregard them and go along with the surgery anyway, but at least then she would have been FULLY INFORMED.

Go along with your junior doctor when they have to consent a patient for a procedure and watch the way they do it; read the form they are required to sign, then ask if you can consent someone (being supervised of course) as it is a good skill to have from an early stage. Remember the motto of medical learning: see one, do one, teach one. Your junior doctors will be glad that you can help them out with their work load, rather than just hang around them watching them expectantly….



Rule Number 2- There is a Difference Between Active/Passive Euthanasia and Murder, But Only a Small One!

Euthanasia will become a huge part of your ethical debates. For example, is taking someone’s life support away euthanasia or murder, because you are actively doing something that you know will bring about the death of your patient? This is in fact known as active euthanasia when it is done in the patient’s best interests; this is when continued treatment will only cause more suffering for the patient, when treatment is only prolonging an inevitable death, or when continued treatment is not in the best interests of the patient. Passive euthanasia is when you decide not to give treatment at all, knowing that it will eventually bring about the death of your patient.

Airedale National Health Service Trust v. Bland (1992/3) This is a very well-known case, and one your consultants are likely to quiz you on.  Anthony Bland was involved in the Hillsborough disaster and sustained significant brain damage which left him in a permanent vegetative state. It was his cerebral cortex which was damaged, meaning that he could not move, see, hear or feel anything (but you already knew that, right…..) His brainstem was left intact, which meant that his body still carried out reflexive functions such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. He was fed through a nasogastric tube, had a permanent catheter (which frequently gave rise to infections) and had his bowels opened via enemas. Anthony’s cerebral cortex was beyond repair, and it was the undisputed opinion of medical experts that he would not make any kind of recovery, but could stay in his current state for years if this level of care was continued. His parents and physicians all shared the view that sustaining life in this case was not benefitting the patient in any way, and they appealed to remove life support.  Because Anthony was unconscious he was not able to consent to any procedures himself, so it was assumed that his parents had his best interests at heart, which was confirmed by the fact that his doctors had the same wishes[i].

The problem with this case was that at the time, the doctor who withdrew lifesaving/prolonging treatment could be accused of murder. The doctor and parents won the case, and on 19th November 1992 Anthony Bland was allowed to die, 3 years after the disaster that put him in a coma.

Even today, cases like this are going to court. There is a very fine line between murder and euthanasia, especially when it involves a medical professional whose job title says they are to prolong life and, to the best of their ability, prevent death.  You will never be alone in cases like this, and in simple terms, if you are not sure what the correct procedure is, ask someone who does and the correct precautions will be taken.



Rule Number 3- If You Have a Gut Feeling, Go With It

   Bolitho v. City & Hackney Health Authority (1998) This case caused much divide between many bodies of expert opinion, and continues to do so today. Patrick Bolitho was a 2 year old who was admitted to St Bartholomew’s Hospital with suspected croup. He was treated by a senior paediatric registrar and later discharged. 5 days later the boy became wheezy and restless and was taken back into hospital, and the next day he was examined by another consultant who thought that his condition was much improved, but that he had decreased air entry on the left hand side.

The next day Patrick had an episode in which he struggled to breathe and became very pale; the nurse in charge thought his condition serious enough to contact the registrar straight away. The registrar told the nurse that she would see the patient as soon as she could. Patrick’s condition improved slightly, and then just over an hour later he had another episode. The nurse contacted the registrar again, who told her that she was in an afternoon clinic and that another doctor would have to see to the boy, at which point the nurse paged another doctor. Neither doctor came to see Patrick during these episodes. Patrick’s condition improved again, but half an hour later things took a turn for the worst and he stopped breathing altogether, bringing about a cardiac arrest. Patrick’s suffered brain damage as a result of the cardiac arrest, and later died[ii].

In this case the nurses knew that something was seriously wrong with the boy on more than one occasion, yet none of them managed to get a doctor to see him; they should have gone with their gut feeling and insisted that a doctor see the boy, and if they had he could have been intubated, which may ultimately have prevented the cardiac arrest. On the other hand, it was the registrar and the other paediatric doctor’s responsibility to see to their patient, who was quite obviously deteriorating (the other doctor stated that their pager had ran out of battery and that they did not receive the message. Moral of the story: your bleeper is there for a reason, make sure it is always charged or you could get into a lot of trouble!) If you know a child is seriously ill then it is your duty to see to them, and if you can’t, make sure you find someone who can; it should not the sole responsibility of the nurses.



Rule Number 4- Don’t Be So Quick to Judge, Because You Have the Power to Ruin Someone’s Life

A recent case which was given a lot of recent media coverage was that of a mother of 2 who had both children taken off her because it was suspected that she had poured scalding water onto her daughter’s legs. What had in fact happened was that the girl’s nappy had exploded, and the chemical contents had burned her legs. The team responsible for the girl’s care referred her case on to social services as they assumed that the mother had been abusing her, and as a result the girl and her brother were taken away from their mother for 8 months because an expert in the field of burns took the view that the injury was ‘most probably a scald.[iii]’ This is an extremely vague accusation, and the words ‘most probably’ should have been looked at more carefully. If anyone had taken the time to listen to the mother’s account of what happened and sought expect advice on nappies and chemical burns than Natalie Tung may have been spared from the most horrible 8 months of her life. There was also no prior evidence of abuse such as scars, bruises or previous hospital admissions. Yes, a child’s safety is paramount and anything suspicious should be looked into, but it is also true that the parents or carers should be allowed to give their full account of how an injury took place. Don’t be so quick to judge!





Rule Number 5- Do Not Underestimate the Power of Patient Confidentiality

As a student this phrase will be drummed into you day after day, and quite rightly so. As a doctor your patients need to be able to feel as though they can tell you anything, and that is only possible if they trust you. A patient will trust you because they know you are bound by patient confidentiality, meaning you cannot talk to others about their case, for example their family members. Imagine a patient tells you they think they have a sexually transmitted infection, and it turns out they have. You also learn that this person is having an affair, so both of your patient’s sexual partners are at risk: do you tell them? Put simply, you are only allowed to break patient confidentiality if you feel that it will be in the patient’s best interests, or there is a risk of someone being ‘seriously harmed.’ It is your job to decide whether your patient’s partners will be ‘seriously harmed’ if they become infected. The best thing to do is to try and convince the patient to tell their partners themselves, which can obviously be difficult. If the patient tells you they will not be telling their partners then you must decide what action to take, making sure you ask colleagues and ask for advice from medical law professionals.

Gillick vs West Norfolk and Wisbech (1985) In 1982 a mother, Victoria Gillick, took her local health authority to court because she believed that minors (under 16’s) should not be treated without their parent’s consent. She argued that they weren’t yet adults, so to treat them even with their consent, was to treat them without valid consent and could be classed as assault and battery.  During the 3 years leading up to the law regarding Gillick Competence, the court ruled that if a doctor treated a minor without consent from the parents then they would be acting unlawfully.  This lead to a significant drop in the amount of minors who attended their GPs, so as a result the court lifted the previous law and a new one was drafted, named Gillick Competence.

A minor is considered to have Gillick competency if they are able to ‘understand the nature of the advice which is being given: [he/] she must also have sufficient maturity to understand what is involved.’  If a minor was deemed Gillick competent they were then able to consent for their own treatment, and their parents need not be informed[iv].

This is a case that you will hear about a lot during your ethics modules, along with the Fraser Guidelines (which are concerned with contraception and contraceptive advice being given to minors.) If you choose to become a GP then you will be faced with decisions regarding these two sets of guidelines every single day, and not adhering to them could put you in a lot of trouble.



Rule Number 6- Not Everyone Will be Grateful for Your Help-Deal With It

Unfortunately not everyone will happy that you saved their life, even though as a doctor it is your sole purpose to do just that. As a general rule, both doctors and nurses alike find it difficult to treat Jehovah’s Witnesses because of their religious objection to being given any bodily fluids such as blood. This becomes difficult when a patient is brought into A&E with massive blood loss and they need blood stat: you don’t have time to check their religious status so you give them the blood because your main priority is to save their life. Unfortunately, that patient may wake up and accuse you of assault and battery. As long as you can justify your actions to the court then you will generally have nothing to worry about.

  The case of Brown (1997) Darlene Brown was a 26 year old pregnant and competent Jehovah’s Witness who had required a cystoscopy to remove a urethral mass. During the procedure Mrs Brown lost 7 times the amount of blood that would be expected for such a procedure, and when the surgeon ordered 3 pints of blood the patient refused on the grounds of her religion.  Over the next few days Mrs Brown’s haemoglobin level continued to decline to an extremely dangerous level, for both her and her baby. As a result, the hospital petitioned for temporary custody and wardship of ‘foetus Doe’ and the court eventually granted the role to the hospital’s administrator, along with the right for them to consent to one or more blood transfusions when deemed necessary by any attending physician. Darlene was given 6 units of blood whilst being ‘forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated,[v]’ and on 1st July 1996 Mrs Brown gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

The issue with this case is that Darlene Brown was considered to be a competent adult, meaning she could legally consent or refuse treatment. Her baby however, was not able to consent, and Darlene was essentially killing her innocent child by refusing blood.  Had she not been given the transfusion, both her and her baby would have only had a 5% chance of survival. It is often assumed that a parent will always have their children’s best interests at heart, and so they are deemed fit to consent for them. In the case of foetus Brown, the baby’s mother was not acting with her unborn child’s best interests at heart, and so the treatment was forced on her. Were her rights violated? I can guarantee that this is a case you will be pondering over in years to come, still not knowing the answer. In simple terms: there isn’t one, there is only opinion.

Malette v. Schulman (1990) In another case involving a Jehovah’s Witness a patient successfully sued an A&E doctor for administering blood to save the patient’s life, even though they know the patient had a card in her wallet expressing instruction not to do so. The doctor had introduced a foreign substance into the body of a patient without her consent, which the court ruled was a form of battery; even though the doctor was acting with due care to save the patient’s life[vi].

Not everyone will be happy that you have saved their life, but at the end of the day that is what you are being trained to do. If you can stand up in court and say you are still confident with any decision you made whilst at work because it saved a person’s life then you have done all you can. Revel in the little victories- those few patients that thank you for our help, because believe me, there aren’t many!



Rule Number 7- You Cannot Save Everyone

   In re A.C. D.C. Circuit reproductive rights case (1987) When Angela Stoner was 13 she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. After years of treatment she survived. Unfortunately the disease reappeared years later when Angela was 26 weeks pregnant. She was only given days to live, and in an attempt to prolong her life after all of the suffering she had previously been through she asked if she could undertake chemotherapy, regardless of the risks to her unborn child. Doctors refused to give her chemotherapy on the grounds that it was likely to harm the foetus, and instead inserted a nasogastric tube for feeding and sedatives. This was nothing to do with saving her life, just trying to keep her alive long enough to allow the foetus a good chance of survival. Administrators of the hospital thought that Angela should have a C-section to give the baby a chance to survive, but her husband (and the attending doctors) opposed the procedure on the grounds that she would not have consented for it and she may not have survived it. The procedure was authorised and went ahead, even with the patients pleas of ‘I don’t want it done.’ The baby survived only a few hours and Angela died 2 days later.

Again this case causes many disputes. Angela was going to die no matter what treatment she was given, and some doctors say the right thing to do would have ben to let her die pain free and peacefully. Others disagree and argue that the foetus is a patient too, and it should have a chance of survival; it needs someone who has its best interests at heart to consent for and refuse treatment, and at this moment in time Angela only had her own best interests at heart. Essentially, Angela was always going to die, but it was not always certain that her baby would. Is it not better that one person was given the chance to survive the whole ordeal than none at all?



Rule Number 8- Never Lie to a Patient- Especially One Who Works for the BBC!

   Hatcher Vs Black (1954) Hatcher was a woman who used to broadcast for the BBC. She was told she had hyperthyroidism (a toxic thyroid gland) and that she would need surgery to remove the gland. The thyroid gland, as I am sure you know (I made the mistake of not knowing during surgery to remove the thyroid gland once, believe me the operating room is not somewhere where you want to look stupid!) and Hatcher quite rightly asked if there would be any risk of damage to her voice. She was told there was none and so consented to the surgery.  During your anatomy sessions you will learn that the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (a branch of the Xth cranial nerve: the Vagus nerve) is responsible for voice, and that it runs immediately posterior to the thyroid gland. It would seem obvious then, that damage to this nerve is very likely, and as a result, so is the loss of one’s voice.  Hatcher’s surgeon actually LIED to her; he did not just simply omit the truth.  In the end the surgeon was deemed not liable as he believed he had acted with the patients best interests at heart, because the surgery was vital to her health and if she hadn’t had it done because of the risk to her voice her life could have been in danger. Whether he was found guilty or not he should definitely feel it, as the nerve damage was so severe that she could hardly speak at all and never broadcasted again[vii].

ALWAYS tell your patient the truth to any question they may ask you, because even though you might not be found guilty of lying by the court, you still have to live with your actions for the rest of your life. Treat others as you would like to be treated and you cannot go wrong.

Post.create(title: 'Medical School Breaking Ground Michigan', body: 'The Western Michigan University has begun construction and held a groundbreaking ceremony for a new medical school in Kalamazoo, MI.  The school has received preliminary accreditation from the LCME and can now begin recruiting students.  The WMU School of Medicine will enroll 50 students in their initial class (which will enroll in August, 2014) and their class size will eventually grow to 80.

In our opinion, this is fantastic news for the future of medicine in America, and will help reduce our country’s physician shortage.  How do you feel about this new medical school?  Is this one of the schools you will consider applying to?  Why or why not?

Post.create(title: 'Medical Schools Applicants Minority Enrollment', body: 'The AAMC issued a press release today announcing the most recent statistics on medical school applications and enrollment in the United States. A link to the release can be found below. According to the release, 45,266 students applied to medical school in 2012 and 33,772 of those were first-time applicants, which represents an increase of 3.4% and is an all-time high. The number of students enrolled in medical school for the first time grew by 1.5% to 19,517 – another record number.

“Medicine continues to be a very attractive career choice for our nation’s best and brightest,” said Darrell G. Kirch, M.D., AAMC president and CEO. “Given the urgent need our nation has for more doctors to care for our growing and aging population, we are extremely pleased with the continued growth in size and diversity of this year’s entering class of medical students.”

The increase in applicants and enrollment is very encouraging news for a nation facing a projected shortage of over 90,000 doctors in the next 10 years. Between 2007-2012 there were 11 new medical schools that enrolled their inaugural class. There were 771 students who enrolled in one of these new schools for the first time in 2012. At this rate of growth, the AAMC expects total enrollment for US medical schools to rise 30% by 2016.

American medical schools also saw increases in the number of applicants and enrollment for all major racial and ethnic groups in 2012. Record numbers of African American and Hispanic/Latino students applied to and enrolled in medical school in 2012.

Post.create(title: 'Residency Accreditation Groups Unified', body: 'Beginning in July 2015, all residency programs in the US will be accredited by a single body.  Up until now, residency programs were either accredited by the American Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).  This system had long been confusing for students, physicians, and patients, as it was often difficult to distinguish competency expectations and residency match dates, among other things, from program to program.

“It will simplify the graduate medical education system for the country,” said AACOM President and CEO Stephen Shannon, DO, MPH. “We are collaborating to develop the strongest possible system.”

The new agreement calls for all residency programs to be accredited by the ACGME.  All AOA programs will become ACGME members and the plans are for the ACGME to absorb all current AOA employees.  The agreement allows for greater accountability among residency programs now that there will be uniform standards and competency expectations.

“A unified accreditation system would provide greater opportunity for the AOA and ACGME to share best practices in training physicians, including the implementation of quality improvement programs and performance standards that emphasize positive results, which translates to better and more affordable health care for patients,” AOA president Dr. Ray E Stowers, DO said.', excerpt:"Title", user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'Admissions Officers Support MCAT', body: 'According to a recent article in the Harvard Crimson, nearly nine out of ten medical school admissions officers support the changes coming to the MCAT in 2015.  Of the notable changes coming to the exam, perhaps the most controversial is the addition of a new section on Behavioral Sciences.  This section will require students to have a knowledge of psychology and sociology.  In addition, the traditional science sections of the exam will require a greater understanding of biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology.

“It is the right time, and it is a good step to take,” said Oona B. Ceder director of premedical and health career advising at Harvard University.

“The MCAT is designed to help pre-meds prepare the kinds of skills and competencies that help them be more efficient and compassionate physicians,” she said.

These changes make it necessary for pre-med students to take many more courses than they traditional would have to prepare for the MCAT.  However, if there is some consolation for students, they will no longer have to prepare for a Writing section.

Post.create(title: 'Obamacare Means Medical Students', body: 'The admissions consultants Veritas Prep recently wrote an article on US News about the pros and cons of Obamacare for medical students.  A link to the original article can be found at the bottom of this post.  Here’s our take on the article and what Obamacare means for you.

With the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the majority of the Affordable Care Act in June and with Obama winning re-election, the major portions of Obamacare are likely here to stay.  So what does that mean for medical students?  It’s nearly impossible to predict exactly how the implementation of the new law will play out, but there are a few things that are likely to happen:

An emphasis on primary care.  The Affordable Care Act aims to increase the number of students going into primary care specialties (especially family medicine and internal medicine).  One way the law makes these specialties more attractive is by increasing reimbursements to those doctors.  Another way the law will help is by increasing scholarships and loan repayment programs for students interested in primary care.  We’ve already seen this happening and we wrote about it earlier here.
More doctors.  It’s no secret that there is a shortage of doctors in this country.  Obamacare seeks to remedy this issue by increasing the number of doctors who train in the US.  There will be more medical schools being built and more students being accepted to current medical schools.  In fact, we’ve recently written about a new medical school breaking ground in Michigan.
More competitive residencies.  This is definitely a potential con of the new law for medical students.  While there will be more medical students in the US, funding for residency programs (which are funded by Medicare) has not been increased.  In fact, there is a current debate about cutting some funding in order to balance the federal budget.  This means that there will be more students competing for the same number of slots, if not less.
All in all, the new healthcare law is incredibly complex and it’s very hard to predict how everything will play out.  However, you should keep these things in mind when deciding whether to pursue a career in medicine!

Post.create(title: 'Type Premed You', body: 'Andy Liang, opinion editor of The Tech, a newspaper at MIT, recently wrote about stereotypes that premed students at his school face.  The article can be found here.  He writes that there are 2 types of premed students at his school: those who are relentlessly competitive and those who realize they are imperfect but challenge themselves to do their best.

He writes that too often premeds fall under the competitive category.  They will work tirelessly to get a perfect GPA and cry after exams when they realize they might not have scored high enough to get an A.  Some will even go so far as to safeguard their notes and shun other students, believing that helping others will somehow ruin a curve and hurt their own grades.

However, as Liang writes, many medical schools are doing everything they can to combat this type of attitude amongst their medical students.  Instead of having students compete, they are encouraging collaboration.  This is evidenced by the recent moves of many schools away from traditional grading systems and instead using Pass/Fail.  In addition, many medical schools are no longer ranking their students and have even put systems in place to make it easier for classmates to share notes.

There are premed students who already think with this mindset.  They are more than willing to form study groups and share notes.  They look at difficult courses as a challenge that can only be overcome with collaboration.  They have a positive personality and a genuine interest in working hard to help others.  These are the types of students many medical schools want.  The students who can work effectively in teams, who can help their classmates to succeed and who make everyone around them better.

Post.create(title: 'Medical Schools Shorter Curriculum', body: 'An article about medical school in Public Radio International recently caught our attention.  The author writes that New York University, along with a group of other medical schools will start offering select students the option of completing medical school in only three years, instead of the traditional four year curriculum.

The article quotes Art Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU. “You have two years of basic science at nearly every medical school. Then two years of clinical rotations; you dip into surgery, you see pediatrics, you get a sense of the different sub-specialties of medicine in the last two years,” he said.

“If you can get that down maybe to a years worth of work and keep the clinical activities as they are, I think you’re going to be able to get the smartest and the best of the medical school class to push through — going summers, starting a little bit early in the three years,” he said.

“It costs about $300,000 and more to get out of medical school given the tuition costs over four years,” he said. “If you can take some of that weight off the back of a medical student I think you’re going to see more people being able to go into a broader set of specialties.”

“You’re probably talking about $60,000 in tuition, room and board and books and all the rest of it — saved out of that $300,000 cost,” he said.

NYU will select about 10 percent of its incoming class to try out the new three-year curriculum.  The school will monitor those students and measure their success before deciding whether to expand the program.  One of the key measures of success will be whether those students are admitted to the residency programs they want to attend.

While the program sounds good on the surface, we’re not convinced it is better for students in the long run.  One potential drawback will be preparation for the USMLE Step 1 exam, which extensively tests students’ knowledge of the basic medical sciences learned in the first 2 years.  It remains to be seen if students who spend less time in those sciences can excel on the exam.  Another drawback is the added stress placed on students to start earlier and work through summers.  Medical students are already prone to burnout without this added burden.  We’re also skeptical of the claimed financial benefit.  If students will be required to start earlier and go through summers, will they still be able to reap the benefits of tuition savings?  We doubt the university will offer these extended sessions for students at no cost to them.  What are your thoughts on this new program?

Post.create(title: 'Career Comparison Shopping With Locum Tenens Positions', body: 'Today we have a guest post about locum tenens positions submitted to us by Adam Ghosh. This is very valuable information to keep in mind about your future career and how to decide what job situation is right for you.

Adam Ghosh has over twenty years’ experience as a researcher in the medical field. In that time he has worked with allergists and vascular surgeons, and everyone in between. Now he supplements his early retirement by contributing to Weatherby Healthcare.

One of the most valuable experiential byproducts to be gleaned from attending med school and a residency tour (or tours) is determining the professional preferences of an aspiring medical professional. I don’t know how many times I’ve encountered a student (or former student) whose original career path-plan or specialty practice-preference changed based on a class they took or time spent as a resident. Finding out what works for you and what you enjoy is obviously a huge part of the process, but discerning what you don’t like is at least as important. Once the practice particulars have been sorted an equally important and far longer term decision awaits- where do you want to settle and into what sort of practice?

Often, realizations and conclusions about specialization, location and position are settled by factors that never would have occurred to someone before school or residency. One friend of mine was dead set on becoming a rural pediatrician until the studying she did for an obstetrics and gynecology course (which she found fascinating despite having never considered it beforehand) introduced her to OB/GYN politics, history and culture, which she found undeniable. Another friend’s discovery of true crime paperbacks in med school led him to pathology.

Similarly, I’ve had colleagues that swore off their rural practice because of the travel, isolation and commute. I know several that loved working in the ER during residency but found the hospital politics unpalatable once they were officially employed. There are any number of additional examples I can cite but no need to belabor the point: there’s no teacher like experience and before you choose your hospital/clinic/private practice as a GP/podiatrist/neurosurgeon in the urban/rural/suburban north/south/east/west, it’s never a bad idea to test drive it.

A great tool for doing so is taking locum tenens contracts in or near places that appeal in the employment situation you’re considering (maybe more than one of them, if possible)- hospital, big/small; clinic, public/private; practice, urban/rural, etc. Tenure as a locum tenens provides a real-time window to your future somewhere. Often a wider window than is granted by visiting a place is all-important. If you’re dreaming of a job in tropical Hawaii or the beautiful, verdant Pacific Northwest, living and working there for a year is going to be a substantially better litmus test for your patience with year-round heat and very expensive dairy products or six months of rain (all of which, oddly, appeals to me; I’m lactose intolerant).

And that week-long jaunt to New York during which you fell in love with the Big Apple may not accurately reflect your relationship after a year of subway commuting and your $1800-a-month closet-sized studio apartment. (Then again, it might prove a perfect reflection.)

Perhaps your love of skiing brought you to rural Idaho. Better to find out before you settle down that your fervently liberal politics prove a poor fit with the Gem State. (Or that your Fox News bumper sticker wins you no friends in San Francisco.) As briefly mentioned- the same goes for your place of employment. Even if you are a committed hospitalist, the culture, politics, management and care style, focus and atmosphere can obviously vary significantly. Your experience at an urban hospital in Boston is going to contrast considerably with an experience at an urban hospital in Los Angeles, much less a small, rural hospital in Mississippi.

The locum tenens dynamic is, in my opinion, underutilized. Particularly for someone considering more than one location or employer, working as a locum tenens is almost always an effective means of establishing a preference. If you’re recently out of school or otherwise in a position to do so- look into some locum tenens positions. Chances are you won’t regret it.', excerpt:"Title", user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'A Window Into The Life Of A Traveling Clinical Psychologist', body: 'Today we have a guest post from Vance Hobbes, a freelance writer and former medical researcher about the life of a traveling clinical psychologist.

I was a clinical psychologist for 21 years, and was fortunate enough to travel to some very unique places around the world. I mainly worked with unfortunate children, whether that because of recent turmoil within their home country or trouble at home, each of my cases contributed to an overall better understanding of how various minds and social groups function within specific circumstances. I’ll do my best to cover my first situation in a concise and reader-friendly manner, but honestly I find it difficult not including each and every detail over that period, but perhaps an autobiography will be in the works someday to accomplish that goal. So, here goes.

In 1990 I received my graduate degree from University of Nevada (Reno), and was honestly burnt out from spending most of my life buried in books and taking study breaks at local coffee shops. So, I figured I’d take a couple years off before finding work as I was able to make minimum student loan payments at relatively low interest rates. So I thought, ‘hmm what to do to reward myself?’ So I set up a trip to Sri Lanka as because I met a couple of my really good friends at school from there. Five weeks prior to my trip, I get a call from a group looking for some young people to travel to a place called Lebanon which was recovering from a recent civil war. The UN had contacted this company and called the situation in dire need of psychological assistance, not only was the national government in need of reparations but the various local populations were in the process of recovering as well. I hadn’t really ever thought of my job as an international duty, but I thought, ‘what a great opportunity to travel as well as practice what I had been training years for.’ My Sri Lankan buddies were pretty bummed, but to get paid to travel was not something I was about to pass up.

When I landed in Lebanon, I honestly had no idea what to expect. The place was a mess, but I was surprised to learn only around 17,000 Lebanese casualties (not including civilian) had resulted from the conflict. I understood it had just been involved in an 8-year civil war, but had no idea this would constitute the aftermath. My duty was to reach out to children with broken families, orphans, and those injured from the tools of war. Those first few weeks were extremely difficult for me to cope with. I’ve never been an emotional person, but those first weeks were the most sobering and grim of my entire life. One of my kids had lost his eye and could barely see out his other due to a munitions blast that had killed his brother and left Ruri severely burned. When treating him, I would rarely get a dozen words out of him per week, so advised him to either nod or shake his head to answer my questions. Over time he started to feel more comfortable with me, and the sorrow from losing a family member thawed away and melted into guilt-trip for not protecting his younger brother. This was difficult for him but a common thought process and easy to diagnose. It’s been years since I’ve spoken to Ruri but when I left in 1993 he was working and had met a very pretty girl of which he spent much of his time with.

I also spent time at a child daycare just outside Beirut and essentially gave my time to supervise the children living there. Indirectly, I helped various children who had suffered from social and familial disturbances through simple conversational means. For example I met a little 9-year old who went by the name of Mahmoud who hadn’t been directly affected by the war but knew quite a few friends who had lost someone or had lost their homes amidst the conflict. He could not come to terms with why it seemed as if everyone but him had something bad happen to them. It was definitely difficult connecting with the boy as a foreigner who had not experienced the war and the hell it brought. Because I had lost one of my parents while relatively young, I was able to use my experience as an inlet and convince the boy how fortunate he truly was to be unaffected by the terrible situation of war. His parents had been working in northern Lebanon (Tripoli) for a few months but remained in regular contact with their son. It was at this point in time when I had a much greater appreciation for any familial relationship and dearly missed my own back in the states. My assignment would end around eight months later, so my grief soon ended and I returned home.

Although my trip to Lebanon only identifies one of my many traveling psychologist assignments, the lessons learned through that trip were applied to subsequent travels I partook in. Understanding each child’s unique circumstances allowed me to approach each situation from a different perspective. I was able to diagnose, treat, and largely ease a child’s pain based upon what I had studied in school and through my experiences with other individuals I had either interned with or came across during my lifetime. In conclusion, the world of the traveling psychologist can be scary at times. Meeting kids like Ruri and Mahmoud and helping them deal with psychological and emotional distress has by far brought me the most satisfaction. I feel like the luckiest man in the world to have had these experiences, and would be happy to speak with any student looking to be a traveling psychologist or who has pondered the prospect prior.

Post.create(title: '5 Steps Crucial To Get Into Medical School', body: 'Today we have a guest post from Joe Baxter on the crucial steps to getting into medical school. Enjoy!

Joe Baxter worked in medical research for the majority of his life. In his spare time, he enjoys traveling abroad, working in his wood shop and freelance writing about medical news.

You can read all the stories you want about preparing for Medical school, but each person’s experience is a little different. It’s difficult to prepare for, stressful, and once finished you probably question if it was worth all that time and effort seemingly chucked out the window. But it is worth it. If you truly are committed to studying medicine, it’s worth every minute of your time taken. Bestowed upon you is the right to decide whether a medical action is reasonable, comfortable, invasive or painful. I don’t need to tell you that the world of medicine is saturated with conflicting and controversial decisions. But if you are desirous to answer yes, then here are a few of my steps which helped me get into Medical school.

Know your decision. If you are dead-set on becoming a family health physician or within another realm of medicine, you have already known for a while. You can’t just one day obtain an epiphany from some higher power telling you to go to Medical school because you made the grades in high school and college. It is completely your decision to determine if this is right for you. Med school is an enormous step, so know exactly what you’re getting into before making the jump. Know how Medical school works, the schools you apply to, and what these next eight years will entail.
Apply early. You hear it quite a bit, but waiting a few days instead of filling out apps or waiting until the next scheduled MCAT can cost you an additional year of living out of your parents’ garage.
Volunteer. It doesn’t matter if you spend two hours a week scrubbing the backsides of residents at a retirement home, because it’s something to throw on your Medical school resume showing you were at least active, involved, and willing to start at the bottom. Med school committees want to see if you are in this for the long haul. It’s those little jobs that separate you from all those other applicants. After all, they want to know not only if you are committed to make it through eight years of additional schooling, but also if they can trust you to hold people’s lives in your hands after the education. If you can’t handle those unglamorous jobs now, you won’t be committed later. Get out, intern, and give away your time.
Communication. Write, talk, talk, and write some more. Practice this. A hefty portion dictating whether you get into Med school depends on how well you come across to interviewers and the review committees. Your written statement(s), interview skills, and overall ability to speak clearly, concisely, and thoughtfully give those reviewing your entrance request a great picture of how prepared you are. Grab your intern adviser, a professor, or even your sister and practice interviewing in front of them. Wear the exact same clothing, hairstyle, and dress jacket you would wear to the interview. Make great eye contact, carefully listen to each posed question, and answer uniquely and truthfully.
Your answers before their questions. This is a tangent from #4, but ensure you are prepared to answer any and all questions the committee can throw at you. Obviously, you’ll want to know how to answer, “why do you want to become a doctor,” “why is this Medical school right for you,” and “tell me about this C in organic chemistry.” But be prepared for the questions that can catch you off-guard. Questions such as motivational tools you put use to, how do you handle stress, or should doctors be allowed withdraw life support from terminally-ill patients. Many of the questions that stump interviewees are those which may catch an applicant completely off-guard and force them to begin stuttering like a bumbling fool. Preparedness is not something that comes overnight, so begin practicing months ahead of time.', excerpt:"Title", user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'What Can Nursing Schools Do To Attract More Men', body: 'Kathryn Norcutt had a rewarding career in nursing and now is spending her time writing and passing along knowledge gained from years of experience and research. If you are interested in becoming a travel nurse, take advantage of her wise insights regarding the nursing profession.

What Can Nursing Schools Do To Attract More Men?

In today’s society, there are still job-related stereotypes that remain from decades past. For example, only men were mechanics in the past. However, many women are entering the field today. The opposite applies for nursing. While this job was viewed as a woman’s work in decades past, more and more men are joining the ranks today. Nursing is a field that is constantly growing in complexity and tasks. As today’s society continues to equalize in jobs and in other ways, expect to see more male nurses. There are plenty of benefits to having men in the nursing profession. Some of these include the following:

Men generally have good physical strength, which enables them to do heavy lifting.
It is common for many difficult female patients to cooperate better with male nurses.
Male patients who do not want female nurses helping them with private care will appreciate male nurses.
Since female nurses do not want men to outshine them, having male nurses on staff can provide healthy and friendly competition for everyone to perform at their best.
It is a common occurrence that having one or more men on staff cuts down on gossip and cattiness in the workplace.
Male nurses tend to be passionate about what they do, so they often encourage patients, visitors and coworkers without even trying.

Attracting Men to the Nursing Profession

With all of the great benefits associated with having male nurses on staff, it is important for both schools and employers to encourage men to enter the field. Male nurses only make up approximately five percent of the workforce in the nursing profession. To appeal to men, it is important to find the aspects of nursing that would make them want to consider joining. The following are some good ways educational institutions can attract more male nursing students:

Dispel the stereotype that nursing is a profession for women.
Stress the complex technological aspects of various specialties.
List the wide range of specialty areas that might appeal more to men. For example, cardiology would likely be more attractive to them than labor and delivery.
Stress that nursing is much more than bedside care and bathing.
List some examples of how men can advance and promote in nursing careers.
Suggest some adventurous and exciting opportunities such as travel nursing.
Men are practical creatures, so emphasize the long-term stability of nursing careers, good pay and attractive benefits.
If program guides include stock photos of nursing professionals, be sure to include pictures with male nurses.
Whenever possible, have male recruiters meet with prospective male students.
Make sure men who are enrolled know they have a solid support system to avoid having them drop out or change majors.


In addition to emphasizing these important points, nursing schools and program directors should consider raising the bar on their entrance requirements. Men naturally enjoy competition and challenges, so they are not as likely to be attracted to a program that is extremely easy to enter. If the requirements are stricter, they may find the challenge more attractive. Some schools saw not only the number of applicants rise after doing this but also the number of applications from men.
Source: http://www.minoritynurse.com/men-nursing/recruiting-men-nursing-school



Fortunately, more men have been entering the field since the recession in the late 2000s. Many schools will still need to put forth some extra effort to see the number of their male nursing students rise. Reaching out to hospitals and nursing homes by encouraging them to add tuition reimbursement or other benefits is a good way for schools to attract more male students. Program directors should encourage administrators in these facilities to reach out to current male employees in other departments that pay less. If they are presented with an attractive opportunity to learn for an affordable cost but also receive better pay and benefits in the future, many are likely to be enticed enough to jump on the offer. Social media, newsletters and other correspondence that is available to the public can also be helpful. If every school puts forth the effort, more men will likely enter the field and add their valuable contributions to the many positive contributions women are currently providing.

Post.create(title: 'Writing Tips For Medical School Admission Essays', body: 'Byline: Alex is a student, writer and a blogger. He can help you to write an admission essay. Follow him on twitter @AlexPetryck.

Admission essays are very much important to the school you are applying. Their significance might not seem very huge but they count when you want to be accepted at a specific university. Students tend to complicate their admission essays since, first they’re not aware of who will read their essays and second, because they don’t know how the readers want them. Nevertheless, you should avoid all that panic about what’s unknown and write your story-plain simple. Keep it interesting, and most important, write the truth.

Your admissions essay should be able to pass a message to the admissions committee of the school you’re applying to. While Medicine is not a common or a mere ordinary course for everyone, when you’re writing an admission essay for a course to study it, you have to showcase intelligent and a calling.

In writing your admissions essay therefore, put on paper why you are suitable for this course and how you intend to grow yourself with the help of the medical community from the school. Probably be creative and twist your reasons of wanting to join their medical school and some day become a doctor or a neurologist. Every admissions board loves to read something unique because similar reasons written by every applicant to their course tends to be boring. It helps if you go into the essays writing process, knowing this.

The only thing to save the committee from dozing off while reading your piece is to awaken them with an outstanding admissions essay. Write an essay that complements all the experiences you’ve had since childhood- for instance if you ever cleaned out wounds as a child or participated as a first aid attendant in high school etc., writing from real life desirable experience will boost your appeal.

Tips to writing an acceptable medical admissions essay

Answer the essay question

It is very easy to write irrelevant information in your medical admissions essay. Some students will write everything not related to the medical field, which is the only important thing for the admission board. When you are given a certain essay question, analyze it correctly and at no stage should you forget you’re applying to med school. What is important to them is your experience to do with medicine as a career and why the developing a career dream through them is your primary goal.

Write your story

Do not try to copy someone else story to portray yourself as the best suited to get a chance at joining the medical school. You are supposed to be writing about your personal history; you must have one that would make your gut want to go to med school. Make it even more interesting by adding instances where you have had to take care of the sick in your community and all will be perfect.

Grammar and spelling errors

Even though you have written your admissions essay perfect simple spelling and grammatical mistakes may let you down. The admissions committee member is also keen to recruit an all-round student. Check your sentences and paragraphs to make sure they’re not too lengthy. Write short, valuable and interesting sentences. Use active voice as much as possible and make sure your paragraphs flow from one to the other seamlessly.

Read to a few friends to get their view

Sharing out your writing with friends will help to give you feedback on what you should improve. They might help you to reanalyze your answers and make them more interesting or unique. Moreover, they can give you their contributions on unique personal experiences to help you connect your personality much better.

Revise your admissions essay

With the feedback you receive from your friends, add new ideas to modify your essay. Additionally get rid of simple mistakes that were invisible to your eyes.  Read aloud several times to ensure your admission essay flows to the conclusion part before submitting it.

Post.create(title: 'Direct BSMD From High School To Medical School Sign Me Up', body: 'There are thousands of pre-medical students that apply for medical school each year, and only a slim percentage gain admission. It’s distressing that students who have dreamed of becoming a physician all of their lives simply cannot because their application to medical school was poor. They spend years retaking the MCAT and reapplying, cycle after cycle, only to continuously get rejected by medical schools. What if there was a way to guarantee one’s spot in medical school early on? I’m talking about as early as high school. Well, there is – and not many people know about it.

Such programs hold many names, ranging from “direct BS/MD” to “guaranteed admissions.” Once one gains admission into this program in their senior year in high school, they go on to spend a few years in a specific undergraduate university, then four years in medical school. There are accelerated programs, which are either 6 or 7 years right out of high school, or the non-accelerated ones which are 8 years.

These combined medical programs (yet another name) have different requirements (depending on the school) that must be met to keep one’s status as direct BS/MD student. Some programs require a minimum score on the MCAT while others waive it altogether. They typically require a minimum GPA to be met throughout one’s undergraduate career, and perhaps require one to attain a certain number of volunteer hours or take a specific set of courses. Regardless, once these criteria are met, the student has a seat in medical school with their name on it. These programs require students to apply in their senior year, during the typical admissions cycle in high school. There are upwards of 65 such programs offered across the country, yet they are not advertised as brightly as they should be.

Even earlier than the application cycle, and definitely more important, is the preparation period. A potential applicant must spend hundreds of hours volunteering at a hospital and must have the very best grades and standardized exam scores. They should also present various shadowing and research experiences to show they have seen and interacted closely with the medical profession, and to show they have gone above and beyond most high school students. This paired with excellent recommendation letters, well-written essays, and a great interview will almost guarantee a student admission into one of these programs. From high school, the applicant must know they want to pursue a career in medicine, and must convey that throughout their application cycle.

Getting accepted into a medical school in high school is probably one of the most beneficial things a student interested in medicine can do. It saves you the headache you’ll encounter applying to medical school later on. In addition, you’ll have to work twice as hard distinguishing yourself as an undergrad than when you are in high school.

Post.create(title: 'Nursing As A Second Career', body: 'In today’s world, nursing school is not just for people in their 20’s. Some people choose to enter a nursing program even after retirement. There is no wrong age to enter the field, and students who are older than their peers should not feel intimidated. Older students actually have some very valuable advantages over their younger peers.



Years of Hands-on Experience: Many younger nursing students enroll in programs immediately after graduating high school. However, older students often enter the field after they have raised their children and have also sent them away to college. Some students may have taken care of an elderly or disabled family member at home.


While the technological aspects of a nursing program may seem intimidating, older students often have the upper hand on their younger counterparts when it comes to practical care-giving experience. In a story published by Scrubs Magazine, a former Buddhist priest became a nurse after the age of 50. The man gained an interest in the field after his experience of caring for an ill teacher.



More Confident: Regardless of age, every student will question his or her ability to succeed at some point. This is normal. However, younger students have not had the same life experiences that older students have experienced. For this reason, they are not always able to realistically gauge their abilities. Some may spend too much time socializing. Others may not have been exposed to difficult real-life situations or may drop out.


When older nurses enter the profession, they usually have strong reasons that motivated them to choose that specific field. By the time they enroll, they have also developed confidence in their own abilities. This means that they know their strengths, weaknesses and limits. Older students may still fall under the criticism of seasoned professionals in training. However, they have had enough life experiences to know that they should not take criticism personally. Some younger people may be more emotional and make rash decisions about halting their career when they encounter repetitive criticism.



More disciplined: Rasmussen College outlines this important point. Since older students have had a great deal of life experience, they have learned how to prioritize their time. They have also learned what motivates them and how to stay focused. Perhaps they learned by caring for others, traveling or just paying their own living expenses. Older students tend to avoid the party scene and nightlife that is common with younger students, so they usually find more time to study and absorb important information.
The unique experiences that students who are seasoned in life bring to the classroom do not only benefit them personally. By exercising their leadership capabilities, older nursing students can help motivate and educate younger students. They can teach them how to prioritize their tasks, motivate themselves and recognize the reality of caring for other human beings. Seasoned students can teach their younger peers a greater appreciation and value for life.

While dosage calculations and medical terminology are essential for performing the functions of many nursing jobs correctly, lessons learned from life experiences are even more valuable for the emotional and mental aspects of all nursing jobs. According to Heritage Newspaper, some of the best nursing program directors are more concerned about an applicant’s passion and bedside manners during an admission evaluation. For readers who still feel skeptical about the challenges of learning new technology, keep in mind that younger students will likely share their tech knowledge in exchange for some sensible information that will last them a lifetime.

The main purpose of going to college is getting a quality education (well, at least for most students), but the things students learn during that period of life extend beyond the lectures they hear in class. College is all about learning how to become responsible and manage to live on your own without asking for more money from your parents. Becoming self-sufficient is not an easy process, but it can be made easier if you follow the right guidelines. This article will provide you with tips on how to spend (and save) your money in a smart way.

1. Save on living expenses!

Now that you are living away from your parents, the bills will be on your back; and that’s not an easy burden to deal with. If you never had to pay an electricity bill, the monthly expenses for this purpose may come as a shock to you. You can reduce the electricity usage by using energy efficient bulbs and turning off the lights when you don’t need them. Learning how to use electricity wisely is a small step that will bring you significant savings, and it’s a lesson for life!

Another significant living expense is decorating. Here’s where things get fun, as decorating on a budget is even more pleasurable than being able to spend money on whatever you lay your eyes upon. There are many objects that can be repurposed and used as multifunctional items. Don’t be shy from getting the most of thrift stores, as they hide real gems of lovely furniture pieces that you can bring back to life. Being creative definitely pays out!

2. Be smart with your insurance choices!

Car insurance is constantly getting more expensive, but you can still achieve a better price if you play the right cards. The first thing you should do is check whether your car is worth for comprehensive insurance or not. Besides searching for the best insurance offers online, you should also ask your insurance company about your rights to discount, because the best offers are often not being marketed. You can reduce the amount you pay on insurance by combining policies, annual mileage and good grades.

3. Learn how to save on food!

Coupons are students’ best friends! It is best to do your weekly food shopping with beneficial coupons, but make sure that the coupon is really valuable (it would mean nothing to you if you were purchasing the items in an expensive store). You have to do a price comparison between different stores, because it is pointless to pay more if you can get the same things for a lower price.

Learning how to cook is inevitable in college. You cannot rely solely on fast food, as that would not only bring you health consequences, but it would also be devastating to your budget. It is very easy to cook cheap, simple and highly nutritious meals. Trust me; as soon as you start cooking and experimenting with different ingredients, you will start loving the kitchen!

Remember: if you want to save money on food, it is recommended to stick to the foods that belong to the lower levels of the food pyramid.

4. Learn all about taxation!

Qualifying for larger returns is a clever way of refreshing your budget. If you just got your first job, you should research the Internet for practical tips on tax planning in order to get the most out of the money you make. If you know nothing about taxes and all those rules confuse you, the best recommendation is to work with a tax service, as it can really help you get qualified for bigger returns.

5. Have fun, but stay within the limits!

Students in college would have limitless fun if they weren’t limited by their budgets. In fact, being limited with money is a good thing because it keeps you reasonable and responsible. You can still have fun without spending too much money – all you need are good friends, great music and cheerful spirit. When it comes to good music, iTunes is not your only source, you know. There are lovely coffee shops with great live music that’s free and much better.

You don’t have to go to bars and clubs each weekend in order to enjoy your free time. Sure, clubs are a great place for meeting new people, but such a night out always costs you a lot of money. Moreover, staying on campus and enjoying the company of your friends can bring all of you closer, because there is nothing natural about the contact you make in clubs.

Conclusion: It’s not difficult to live within the limits

Being short on money is never pleasant, but you can learn how to manage the situation as soon as you get into the habit of spending your money wisely. Remember to stay organized, keep track of your income and expenses and take the necessary measures if you can’t reach a positive balance in the end of the month (yes, I’m trying to tell you to get a job).', excerpt:"Title", user_id:1)
