Post.create(title: '5 Reasons Social Media Good Pre Meds', body: 'By: Roheet Kakaday

After allowing The Biopsy public exposure and starting a Twitter account for it, I learned one important thing – I wish had done so sooner. The digital age of medicine is upon us and shaping a beneficial online presence is going to be one of the most critical activities a physician can undertake. Physicians, whether they like it or not, will have a de facto online presence due to doctor rating websites. As Dr. Vartabedian so aptly said, “Google is the new CV.”

So what can you, the budding premed, do to grapple with the ever-expanding digital domain? Instead of deleting your social media presence online in a mad rush to cover your tracks during the application season, you could use social media to your advantage. Danielle Jones, at Mind On Medicine, has covered this question in regards to residency interviews, but the concept is applicable to premeds as well. By cultivating a meaningful social media presence, you can impress medical schools and create another substantive activity on your résumé. Here are five reasons why I think every premed should have an online persona:

1. You learn new ideas fast.

Ideas move at the speed of the Twitterverse, which may or may not be faster than the speed of light. Once you’ve connected with other people, your Twitterfeed gets flooded with good ideas, on which you can build new concepts, contrast existing ones, and reflect on your opinions.

Once I started my Twitter account and followed notable movers-and-shakers in the online medical sphere (@AAMCtoday, @drmikesevilla, @kevinmd, just to name a few), I kept receiving more tweets than I knew what to do with. By plugging into this network you’ll start hearing the rumbling of new concepts – concepts that could change medicine’s future – well before anyone else does.

2. It creates dialogue.

Dialogue is part and parcel of an online media presence. If you want to be heard you need to speak up, in 140 characters that is. Twitter is teeming with users debating new ideas that may be applicable to you. Get in on that! Medicine is all about communication so it seems fitting that the internet be a medium of such communication. When you’re debating or agreeing with someone on Facebook Twitter, or your blog, you’ll be participating in valuable dialogue that’s beneficial for all parties.

3. It helps develop your bearings in medicine.

What are you most interested in? Emergency medicine? Medical education? Health information technologies? Have no idea at all? Well that’s okay too. By monitoring Twitter debates, following other medical personas, or reading responses to your blog posts, you’ll get a better picture of what you’re interested in and what you may or may not have a semblance of expertise in. Why is that important? By honing in on what you’re curious about, you’ll develop a stronger sense of what your interests are. That will make your premed path much easier and more focused.

Let’s say Billy is a premed who likes primary care and computers. When he was 14, Billy built his own computer and coded his own applications. In college, Billy started an online persona and found himself contributing to debates in primary care and computers. Reading the responses in both arenas, he found himself drawn towards #HIT (Health Information Technology) more so than #FMRevolution (Family Medicine Revolution) tweets on Twitter. Because of this, Billy went on to develop meaningful opinions about electronic health records and even coded his own health-related mobile app. Billy now has something awesome to put on his medical school application.

Don’t worry if you don’t find your bearings quickly. I’ve been at it for a short while now and I’m still interested in everything! Sooner or later, though, I assume everyone will find their niche.

4. You’ll mature more quickly.

Medical schools are highly concerned with recruiting mature individuals. Once you’ve amassed a modest following on the internet, you’re sure to find people who challenge your ideas. I was initially afraid of this, but it actually is a good thing. You’ll be forced to reflect on your ideas, sometimes even modify them, but don’t think of this as somehow reflecting poorly on you. We premeds are still young and our perspectives are still developing. By exposing your ideas to the public, you’ll be, in a sense, smelting them into stronger convictions indicative of maturation.

In response to the feedback you receive on your thoughts, you’ll become more wary of what you publish on the blogosphere or Twitterverse. Dr. Vertabedian posted an interesting piece on online physician image and its juxtaposition with the traditional clean-cut physician image. Online, we are who we fashion ourselves to be. Thus, if you’re interested in maintaining a professional online persona, you’ll start thinking more professionally. The posts you develop will be more thought out and nuanced. In medicine, physicians always have to be deliberate and cautious with the words they use. By developing a professional online persona, you’ll already have practice in that art, which puts you one step ahead of the competition.

5. You can easily contribute meaningfully.

Unlike research, which takes months, if not years, to come up with valuable results, social media runs on instant gratification. You can contribute meaningfully through various platforms and have instant feedback on how you’re doing. During research conferences, where you need to be someone to be heard, all you need in Twitter handle to start sharing ideas. That’s your ticket to jumping in on dialogue and contributing your opinions to the masses. What other avenue is so easily accessible in medicine?

Of course, this is all assuming you’re not an inflammatory individual who tries to provoke incendiary comments. Rational and calm debate is the best way to get ideas across. Furthermore, it’s important that you maintain HIPAA compliance by changing names, genders, locations, or any other kind of identifying information. If you follow these rules, you’re golden.

Post.create(title: 'Medical School Early Decision', body: 'What Should I Consider About the Medical School Early Decision Program?

The medical school early decision process is much different from college early decision.  When applying to college, you can apply to one school early decision and also submit normal applications to any other college you’d like.  With medical school, if you choose to apply early decision, you cannot apply to any other medical schools until you receive a decision from your early decision school.

Most medical schools offer interview invitations and admission decisions on a rolling basis.  Therefore, your chances are much better if you apply early in the process.  Students who want to have the absolute best chance at admission often submit their applications before August.  However, if you apply early decision, you might not hear back from the school until October.  If you are not accepted, this can leave you in a mad scramble to apply to other schools.  You will have tons of secondary applications to fill out and even if you finish them quickly, your application will still arrive late in the process and you will be at a disadvantage compared to those who submitted early.

Our Advice on Medical School Early Decision

For this reason, we almost never recommend the medical school early decision program.  For the vast majority of students, it is simply not worth the risk.  You would be much better off applying early to a broad range of schools.

There are a couple of cases where early decision might be beneficial.  For example, if you have your heart set on one particular school and would never go anywhere else.  If you are only applying to one school and will only consider attending that one school, early decision would be the way to go.  The program might also be beneficial for elite applicants.  For example, if you are sure you want to go to school X and your statistics are well above that school’s averages, go ahead and apply early.  If for some reason you aren’t accepted, you might still have a good chance applying to other schools late because of your high statistics.

Overall, while the early decision program sounds like a good idea in theory, its negatives far outweigh the positives for the majority of applicants.  If you are thinking about applying early decision, please keep this in mind.

Post.create(title: 'Medical Student Question Jess', body: 'The following question was submitted by one of our readers on our Ask a Medical Student page.  Head over there to read what medical school is like and to ask a question of your own!

“Chris! It is great to hear that there is an opportunity for some fun time. If you could go back to your undergraduate years and tell yourself three things, what would they be? My school lacks premedical help, so I mostly have to look online for information and resources. Thanks for the feedback”

Here’s the response:

“Thanks for the question!  Hopefully you’ve been able to find some good resources online for getting into medical school.  I would probably tell myself the following:

1. Slow down!  Going into medicine is scary for many people because of the amount of time required until you’re finally able to practice.  This made me want to finish undergrad as quickly as I could so I could finish med school as young as possible.  Let me tell you, there are plenty of older students in medical school and they have no regrets.  I think the average age of the incoming class of my school is around 24-25 every year and quite a few students are around 30.  There’s nothing wrong with taking your time getting to med school and enjoying life!

2. Don’t believe everything you hear.  This one probably especially applies to you since you need the internet for information.  There are so many opinions out there about what it takes to get into medical school and medicine.  Take them with a grain of salt and do the research yourself.  Check out official statistics and contact the schools’ admissions offices if necessary.  I remember reading on some forum that I would never get into a certain school without at least a 35 on the MCAT.  I looked up the stats for that school and the average score was a 31.  That means many people who got even below 30 got in!

3. Get into great habits.  I’m not talking about studying here, because if you can get into medical school you probably don’t need advice on how to study.  I’m talking about exercise, eating healthy, and hobbies.  It’s really important to get into these things before you start medical school.  Once you start school, you’ll have less free time and it will be really easy to get into bad habits if you don’t already have good ones.

I hope that helps, thanks again for the question!”', user_id:1)

Top 10 Medical Legal Cases That Every Medical Student Should Know About, and What You Can Learn From Them

By: Niqui Stubbs

As a fresher at a new university you are under a lot of pressure; pressure to make friends, pressure to do well in a new environment, and pressure to indulge in fresher’s week to the point of substituting meals for alcohol whilst trying not a complete fool in front of your intimidating new tutor. Being a university student is scary enough, but as a medical student you are under more pressure than any other student, and as a medical student myself I know this better than anyone (no matter what your mathematician flatmate tries to tell you, maths is not going to help him save the world, or any lives.) You will hear many horror stories of junior doctors, and even well trained consultants getting sued for medical negligence because of something they failed to do or something they did wrong. Many of these will not be true, thankfully, and are simply there to scare you, but there are a significant number of them that are. Dwelling on them at such an early stage is neither practical nor healthy! It is good, however, to learn about what doctors have done wrong in the past so you can be aware of ‘what not to do’ by the time you start your hospital placements, which for some of you is as early as first year.



Rule Number 1- Make Sure the Patient is Fully Informed

   Bolam Vs Friern hospital management committee (1957) Do not disregard this case because of its age; it is one of the most important you will ever read. Bolam was a mentally ill patient who agreed to undergo electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) as part of his treatment. Unfortunately, he was not made fully aware of the risks of this procedure, most notably the risk of fractures if the body was not properly restrained and muscle relaxants not used. As a result of the patient not being fully informed he was not able to request the muscle relaxants and body restrains, and the treatment resulted in him suffering from a broken hip. Bolam put in a claim for negligence, and lost on the grounds that he was merely misinformed of his treatment, not actually treated with negligence.

One of the reasons why this case is so important is that it brought about the term ‘standard of a responsible body of medical men’ meaning that if a case is brought against someone in a particular profession, in this case that of medicine, then the outcome of the case depends on whether the standard of care was at the level, or below the level that would have been given by others in your profession if they were in the same situation. If it is considered below that of the ‘responsible body of medical men’ then a claim of negligence may be given.

It is common sense that you should inform your patient of the risks of ANY procedure, even the small ones, so do not forget the little things. They may stop you from being sued by a very angry, misinformed patient!



   Chester Vs Afshar (2005) Miss Chester was a woman who was referred to a neurologist regarding back pain. The said neurologist told the patient that surgery was the solution, and likely the cure; he failed to inform her of the 1-2% chance of complications. Any doctor should know that even the smallest procedures carry risks, and one as big as surgery (especially SPINAL surgery) is going to have some chance of complications, be it that of blood loss or infection as is common in any surgery, or one more specific to spinal nerve damage.  As it happens, Miss Chester left the theatre with cauda equina syndrome (a syndrome which will soon be drummed into your head as it can lead to permanent paraplegia, sexual dysfunction and both urinal and faecal incontinence) having had no prior knowledge of any risks.

The case is not about whether the patient would have undergone complications regardless of the attending surgeon, because it is likely that she would have done; again it is about a doctor failing to fully inform a patient. If Miss Chester had been aware of the risks she may have chosen not to undergo the surgery and may not now be suffering with such a terrible condition. On the other hand, because the chances of a complication were so small, the patient may have chosen to disregard them and go along with the surgery anyway, but at least then she would have been FULLY INFORMED.

Go along with your junior doctor when they have to consent a patient for a procedure and watch the way they do it; read the form they are required to sign, then ask if you can consent someone (being supervised of course) as it is a good skill to have from an early stage. Remember the motto of medical learning: see one, do one, teach one. Your junior doctors will be glad that you can help them out with their work load, rather than just hang around them watching them expectantly….



Rule Number 2- There is a Difference Between Active/Passive Euthanasia and Murder, But Only a Small One!

Euthanasia will become a huge part of your ethical debates. For example, is taking someone’s life support away euthanasia or murder, because you are actively doing something that you know will bring about the death of your patient? This is in fact known as active euthanasia when it is done in the patient’s best interests; this is when continued treatment will only cause more suffering for the patient, when treatment is only prolonging an inevitable death, or when continued treatment is not in the best interests of the patient. Passive euthanasia is when you decide not to give treatment at all, knowing that it will eventually bring about the death of your patient.

Airedale National Health Service Trust v. Bland (1992/3) This is a very well-known case, and one your consultants are likely to quiz you on.  Anthony Bland was involved in the Hillsborough disaster and sustained significant brain damage which left him in a permanent vegetative state. It was his cerebral cortex which was damaged, meaning that he could not move, see, hear or feel anything (but you already knew that, right…..) His brainstem was left intact, which meant that his body still carried out reflexive functions such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. He was fed through a nasogastric tube, had a permanent catheter (which frequently gave rise to infections) and had his bowels opened via enemas. Anthony’s cerebral cortex was beyond repair, and it was the undisputed opinion of medical experts that he would not make any kind of recovery, but could stay in his current state for years if this level of care was continued. His parents and physicians all shared the view that sustaining life in this case was not benefitting the patient in any way, and they appealed to remove life support.  Because Anthony was unconscious he was not able to consent to any procedures himself, so it was assumed that his parents had his best interests at heart, which was confirmed by the fact that his doctors had the same wishes[i].

The problem with this case was that at the time, the doctor who withdrew lifesaving/prolonging treatment could be accused of murder. The doctor and parents won the case, and on 19th November 1992 Anthony Bland was allowed to die, 3 years after the disaster that put him in a coma.

Even today, cases like this are going to court. There is a very fine line between murder and euthanasia, especially when it involves a medical professional whose job title says they are to prolong life and, to the best of their ability, prevent death.  You will never be alone in cases like this, and in simple terms, if you are not sure what the correct procedure is, ask someone who does and the correct precautions will be taken.



Rule Number 3- If You Have a Gut Feeling, Go With It

   Bolitho v. City & Hackney Health Authority (1998) This case caused much divide between many bodies of expert opinion, and continues to do so today. Patrick Bolitho was a 2 year old who was admitted to St Bartholomew’s Hospital with suspected croup. He was treated by a senior paediatric registrar and later discharged. 5 days later the boy became wheezy and restless and was taken back into hospital, and the next day he was examined by another consultant who thought that his condition was much improved, but that he had decreased air entry on the left hand side.

The next day Patrick had an episode in which he struggled to breathe and became very pale; the nurse in charge thought his condition serious enough to contact the registrar straight away. The registrar told the nurse that she would see the patient as soon as she could. Patrick’s condition improved slightly, and then just over an hour later he had another episode. The nurse contacted the registrar again, who told her that she was in an afternoon clinic and that another doctor would have to see to the boy, at which point the nurse paged another doctor. Neither doctor came to see Patrick during these episodes. Patrick’s condition improved again, but half an hour later things took a turn for the worst and he stopped breathing altogether, bringing about a cardiac arrest. Patrick’s suffered brain damage as a result of the cardiac arrest, and later died[ii].

In this case the nurses knew that something was seriously wrong with the boy on more than one occasion, yet none of them managed to get a doctor to see him; they should have gone with their gut feeling and insisted that a doctor see the boy, and if they had he could have been intubated, which may ultimately have prevented the cardiac arrest. On the other hand, it was the registrar and the other paediatric doctor’s responsibility to see to their patient, who was quite obviously deteriorating (the other doctor stated that their pager had ran out of battery and that they did not receive the message. Moral of the story: your bleeper is there for a reason, make sure it is always charged or you could get into a lot of trouble!) If you know a child is seriously ill then it is your duty to see to them, and if you can’t, make sure you find someone who can; it should not the sole responsibility of the nurses.



Rule Number 4- Don’t Be So Quick to Judge, Because You Have the Power to Ruin Someone’s Life

A recent case which was given a lot of recent media coverage was that of a mother of 2 who had both children taken off her because it was suspected that she had poured scalding water onto her daughter’s legs. What had in fact happened was that the girl’s nappy had exploded, and the chemical contents had burned her legs. The team responsible for the girl’s care referred her case on to social services as they assumed that the mother had been abusing her, and as a result the girl and her brother were taken away from their mother for 8 months because an expert in the field of burns took the view that the injury was ‘most probably a scald.[iii]’ This is an extremely vague accusation, and the words ‘most probably’ should have been looked at more carefully. If anyone had taken the time to listen to the mother’s account of what happened and sought expect advice on nappies and chemical burns than Natalie Tung may have been spared from the most horrible 8 months of her life. There was also no prior evidence of abuse such as scars, bruises or previous hospital admissions. Yes, a child’s safety is paramount and anything suspicious should be looked into, but it is also true that the parents or carers should be allowed to give their full account of how an injury took place. Don’t be so quick to judge!





Rule Number 5- Do Not Underestimate the Power of Patient Confidentiality

As a student this phrase will be drummed into you day after day, and quite rightly so. As a doctor your patients need to be able to feel as though they can tell you anything, and that is only possible if they trust you. A patient will trust you because they know you are bound by patient confidentiality, meaning you cannot talk to others about their case, for example their family members. Imagine a patient tells you they think they have a sexually transmitted infection, and it turns out they have. You also learn that this person is having an affair, so both of your patient’s sexual partners are at risk: do you tell them? Put simply, you are only allowed to break patient confidentiality if you feel that it will be in the patient’s best interests, or there is a risk of someone being ‘seriously harmed.’ It is your job to decide whether your patient’s partners will be ‘seriously harmed’ if they become infected. The best thing to do is to try and convince the patient to tell their partners themselves, which can obviously be difficult. If the patient tells you they will not be telling their partners then you must decide what action to take, making sure you ask colleagues and ask for advice from medical law professionals.

Gillick vs West Norfolk and Wisbech (1985) In 1982 a mother, Victoria Gillick, took her local health authority to court because she believed that minors (under 16’s) should not be treated without their parent’s consent. She argued that they weren’t yet adults, so to treat them even with their consent, was to treat them without valid consent and could be classed as assault and battery.  During the 3 years leading up to the law regarding Gillick Competence, the court ruled that if a doctor treated a minor without consent from the parents then they would be acting unlawfully.  This lead to a significant drop in the amount of minors who attended their GPs, so as a result the court lifted the previous law and a new one was drafted, named Gillick Competence.

A minor is considered to have Gillick competency if they are able to ‘understand the nature of the advice which is being given: [he/] she must also have sufficient maturity to understand what is involved.’  If a minor was deemed Gillick competent they were then able to consent for their own treatment, and their parents need not be informed[iv].

This is a case that you will hear about a lot during your ethics modules, along with the Fraser Guidelines (which are concerned with contraception and contraceptive advice being given to minors.) If you choose to become a GP then you will be faced with decisions regarding these two sets of guidelines every single day, and not adhering to them could put you in a lot of trouble.



Rule Number 6- Not Everyone Will be Grateful for Your Help-Deal With It

Unfortunately not everyone will happy that you saved their life, even though as a doctor it is your sole purpose to do just that. As a general rule, both doctors and nurses alike find it difficult to treat Jehovah’s Witnesses because of their religious objection to being given any bodily fluids such as blood. This becomes difficult when a patient is brought into A&E with massive blood loss and they need blood stat: you don’t have time to check their religious status so you give them the blood because your main priority is to save their life. Unfortunately, that patient may wake up and accuse you of assault and battery. As long as you can justify your actions to the court then you will generally have nothing to worry about.

  The case of Brown (1997) Darlene Brown was a 26 year old pregnant and competent Jehovah’s Witness who had required a cystoscopy to remove a urethral mass. During the procedure Mrs Brown lost 7 times the amount of blood that would be expected for such a procedure, and when the surgeon ordered 3 pints of blood the patient refused on the grounds of her religion.  Over the next few days Mrs Brown’s haemoglobin level continued to decline to an extremely dangerous level, for both her and her baby. As a result, the hospital petitioned for temporary custody and wardship of ‘foetus Doe’ and the court eventually granted the role to the hospital’s administrator, along with the right for them to consent to one or more blood transfusions when deemed necessary by any attending physician. Darlene was given 6 units of blood whilst being ‘forcibly restrained, overpowered and sedated,[v]’ and on 1st July 1996 Mrs Brown gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

The issue with this case is that Darlene Brown was considered to be a competent adult, meaning she could legally consent or refuse treatment. Her baby however, was not able to consent, and Darlene was essentially killing her innocent child by refusing blood.  Had she not been given the transfusion, both her and her baby would have only had a 5% chance of survival. It is often assumed that a parent will always have their children’s best interests at heart, and so they are deemed fit to consent for them. In the case of foetus Brown, the baby’s mother was not acting with her unborn child’s best interests at heart, and so the treatment was forced on her. Were her rights violated? I can guarantee that this is a case you will be pondering over in years to come, still not knowing the answer. In simple terms: there isn’t one, there is only opinion.

Malette v. Schulman (1990) In another case involving a Jehovah’s Witness a patient successfully sued an A&E doctor for administering blood to save the patient’s life, even though they know the patient had a card in her wallet expressing instruction not to do so. The doctor had introduced a foreign substance into the body of a patient without her consent, which the court ruled was a form of battery; even though the doctor was acting with due care to save the patient’s life[vi].

Not everyone will be happy that you have saved their life, but at the end of the day that is what you are being trained to do. If you can stand up in court and say you are still confident with any decision you made whilst at work because it saved a person’s life then you have done all you can. Revel in the little victories- those few patients that thank you for our help, because believe me, there aren’t many!



Rule Number 7- You Cannot Save Everyone

   In re A.C. D.C. Circuit reproductive rights case (1987) When Angela Stoner was 13 she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. After years of treatment she survived. Unfortunately the disease reappeared years later when Angela was 26 weeks pregnant. She was only given days to live, and in an attempt to prolong her life after all of the suffering she had previously been through she asked if she could undertake chemotherapy, regardless of the risks to her unborn child. Doctors refused to give her chemotherapy on the grounds that it was likely to harm the foetus, and instead inserted a nasogastric tube for feeding and sedatives. This was nothing to do with saving her life, just trying to keep her alive long enough to allow the foetus a good chance of survival. Administrators of the hospital thought that Angela should have a C-section to give the baby a chance to survive, but her husband (and the attending doctors) opposed the procedure on the grounds that she would not have consented for it and she may not have survived it. The procedure was authorised and went ahead, even with the patients pleas of ‘I don’t want it done.’ The baby survived only a few hours and Angela died 2 days later.

Again this case causes many disputes. Angela was going to die no matter what treatment she was given, and some doctors say the right thing to do would have ben to let her die pain free and peacefully. Others disagree and argue that the foetus is a patient too, and it should have a chance of survival; it needs someone who has its best interests at heart to consent for and refuse treatment, and at this moment in time Angela only had her own best interests at heart. Essentially, Angela was always going to die, but it was not always certain that her baby would. Is it not better that one person was given the chance to survive the whole ordeal than none at all?



Rule Number 8- Never Lie to a Patient- Especially One Who Works for the BBC!

   Hatcher Vs Black (1954) Hatcher was a woman who used to broadcast for the BBC. She was told she had hyperthyroidism (a toxic thyroid gland) and that she would need surgery to remove the gland. The thyroid gland, as I am sure you know (I made the mistake of not knowing during surgery to remove the thyroid gland once, believe me the operating room is not somewhere where you want to look stupid!) and Hatcher quite rightly asked if there would be any risk of damage to her voice. She was told there was none and so consented to the surgery.  During your anatomy sessions you will learn that the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (a branch of the Xth cranial nerve: the Vagus nerve) is responsible for voice, and that it runs immediately posterior to the thyroid gland. It would seem obvious then, that damage to this nerve is very likely, and as a result, so is the loss of one’s voice.  Hatcher’s surgeon actually LIED to her; he did not just simply omit the truth.  In the end the surgeon was deemed not liable as he believed he had acted with the patients best interests at heart, because the surgery was vital to her health and if she hadn’t had it done because of the risk to her voice her life could have been in danger. Whether he was found guilty or not he should definitely feel it, as the nerve damage was so severe that she could hardly speak at all and never broadcasted again[vii].

ALWAYS tell your patient the truth to any question they may ask you, because even though you might not be found guilty of lying by the court, you still have to live with your actions for the rest of your life. Treat others as you would like to be treated and you cannot go wrong.

The school has received preliminary accreditation from the LCME and can now begin recruiting students.  The WMU School of Medicine will enroll 50 students in their initial class (which will enroll in August, 2014) and their class size will eventually grow to 80.

Post.create(title: 'Medical Schools Applicants Minority Enrollment', body: 'The AAMC issued a press release today announcing the most recent statistics on medical school applications and enrollment in the United States. A link to the release can be found below. According to the release, 45,266 students applied to medical school in 2012 and 33,772 of those were first-time applicants, which represents an increase of 3.4% and is an all-time high. The number of students enrolled in medical school for the first time grew by 1.5% to 19,517 – another record number.

“Medicine continues to be a very attractive career choice for our nation’s best and brightest,” said Darrell G. Kirch, M.D., AAMC president and CEO. “Given the urgent need our nation has for more doctors to care for our growing and aging population, we are extremely pleased with the continued growth in size and diversity of this year’s entering class of medical students.”

The increase in applicants and enrollment is very encouraging news for a nation facing a projected shortage of over 90,000 doctors in the next 10 years. Between 2007-2012 there were 11 new medical schools that enrolled their inaugural class. There were 771 students who enrolled in one of these new schools for the first time in 2012. At this rate of growth, the AAMC expects total enrollment for US medical schools to rise 30% by 2016.

American medical schools also saw increases in the number of applicants and enrollment for all major racial and ethnic groups in 2012. Record numbers of African American and Hispanic/Latino students applied to and enrolled in medical school in 2012.

Post.create(title: 'Residency Accreditation Groups Unified', body: 'Beginning in July 2015, all residency programs in the US will be accredited by a single body.  Up until now, residency programs were either accredited by the American Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).  This system had long been confusing for students, physicians, and patients, as it was often difficult to distinguish competency expectations and residency match dates, among other things, from program to program.

“It will simplify the graduate medical education system for the country,” said AACOM President and CEO Stephen Shannon, DO, MPH. “We are collaborating to develop the strongest possible system.”

The new agreement calls for all residency programs to be accredited by the ACGME.  All AOA programs will become ACGME members and the plans are for the ACGME to absorb all current AOA employees.  The agreement allows for greater accountability among residency programs now that there will be uniform standards and competency expectations.

“A unified accreditation system would provide greater opportunity for the AOA and ACGME to share best practices in training physicians, including the implementation of quality improvement programs and performance standards that emphasize positive results, which translates to better and more affordable health care for patients,” AOA president Dr. Ray E Stowers, DO said.', user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'Admissions Officers Support MCAT', body: 'According to a recent article in the Harvard Crimson, nearly nine out of ten medical school admissions officers support the changes coming to the MCAT in 2015.  Of the notable changes coming to the exam, perhaps the most controversial is the addition of a new section on Behavioral Sciences.  This section will require students to have a knowledge of psychology and sociology.  In addition, the traditional science sections of the exam will require a greater understanding of biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology.

“It is the right time, and it is a good step to take,” said Oona B. Ceder director of premedical and health career advising at Harvard University.

“The MCAT is designed to help pre-meds prepare the kinds of skills and competencies that help them be more efficient and compassionate physicians,” she said.

These changes make it necessary for pre-med students to take many more courses than they traditional would have to prepare for the MCAT.  However, if there is some consolation for students, they will no longer have to prepare for a Writing section.

Post.create(title: 'Obamacare Means Medical Students', body: 'The admissions consultants Veritas Prep recently wrote an article on US News about the pros and cons of Obamacare for medical students.  A link to the original article can be found at the bottom of this post.  Here’s our take on the article and what Obamacare means for you.

With the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the majority of the Affordable Care Act in June and with Obama winning re-election, the major portions of Obamacare are likely here to stay.  So what does that mean for medical students?  It’s nearly impossible to predict exactly how the implementation of the new law will play out, but there are a few things that are likely to happen:

An emphasis on primary care.  The Affordable Care Act aims to increase the number of students going into primary care specialties (especially family medicine and internal medicine).  One way the law makes these specialties more attractive is by increasing reimbursements to those doctors.  Another way the law will help is by increasing scholarships and loan repayment programs for students interested in primary care.  We’ve already seen this happening and we wrote about it earlier here.
More doctors.  It’s no secret that there is a shortage of doctors in this country.  Obamacare seeks to remedy this issue by increasing the number of doctors who train in the US.  There will be more medical schools being built and more students being accepted to current medical schools.  In fact, we’ve recently written about a new medical school breaking ground in Michigan.
More competitive residencies.  This is definitely a potential con of the new law for medical students.  While there will be more medical students in the US, funding for residency programs (which are funded by Medicare) has not been increased.  In fact, there is a current debate about cutting some funding in order to balance the federal budget.  This means that there will be more students competing for the same number of slots, if not less.
All in all, the new healthcare law is incredibly complex and it’s very hard to predict how everything will play out.  However, you should keep these things in mind when deciding whether to pursue a career in medicine!

Post.create(title: 'Type Premed You', body: 'Andy Liang, opinion editor of The Tech, a newspaper at MIT, recently wrote about stereotypes that premed students at his school face.  The article can be found here.  He writes that there are 2 types of premed students at his school: those who are relentlessly competitive and those who realize they are imperfect but challenge themselves to do their best.

He writes that too often premeds fall under the competitive category.  They will work tirelessly to get a perfect GPA and cry after exams when they realize they might not have scored high enough to get an A.  Some will even go so far as to safeguard their notes and shun other students, believing that helping others will somehow ruin a curve and hurt their own grades.

However, as Liang writes, many medical schools are doing everything they can to combat this type of attitude amongst their medical students.  Instead of having students compete, they are encouraging collaboration.  This is evidenced by the recent moves of many schools away from traditional grading systems and instead using Pass/Fail.  In addition, many medical schools are no longer ranking their students and have even put systems in place to make it easier for classmates to share notes.

There are premed students who already think with this mindset.  They are more than willing to form study groups and share notes.  They look at difficult courses as a challenge that can only be overcome with collaboration.  They have a positive personality and a genuine interest in working hard to help others.  These are the types of students many medical schools want.  The students who can work effectively in teams, who can help their classmates to succeed and who make everyone around them better.  Unfortunately, these students seem to be the minority among premeds.

Which type of student are you?  What can we do to break the ultra competitive mentality of many premeds?  How can we encourage collaboration and a welcoming environment?  Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!', user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'Medical Schools Shorter Curriculum', body: 'An article about medical school in Public Radio International recently caught our attention.  The author writes that New York University, along with a group of other medical schools will start offering select students the option of completing medical school in only three years, instead of the traditional four year curriculum.

The article quotes Art Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU. “You have two years of basic science at nearly every medical school. Then two years of clinical rotations; you dip into surgery, you see pediatrics, you get a sense of the different sub-specialties of medicine in the last two years,” he said.

“If you can get that down maybe to a years worth of work and keep the clinical activities as they are, I think you’re going to be able to get the smartest and the best of the medical school class to push through — going summers, starting a little bit early in the three years,” he said.

“It costs about $300,000 and more to get out of medical school given the tuition costs over four years,” he said. “If you can take some of that weight off the back of a medical student I think you’re going to see more people being able to go into a broader set of specialties.”

“You’re probably talking about $60,000 in tuition, room and board and books and all the rest of it — saved out of that $300,000 cost,” he said.

NYU will select about 10 percent of its incoming class to try out the new three-year curriculum.  The school will monitor those students and measure their success before deciding whether to expand the program.  One of the key measures of success will be whether those students are admitted to the residency programs they want to attend.

While the program sounds good on the surface, we’re not convinced it is better for students in the long run.  One potential drawback will be preparation for the USMLE Step 1 exam, which extensively tests students’ knowledge of the basic medical sciences learned in the first 2 years.  It remains to be seen if students who spend less time in those sciences can excel on the exam.  Another drawback is the added stress placed on students to start earlier and work through summers.  Medical students are already prone to burnout without this added burden.  We’re also skeptical of the claimed financial benefit.  If students will be required to start earlier and go through summers, will they still be able to reap the benefits of tuition savings?  We doubt the university will offer these extended sessions for students at no cost to them.  What are your thoughts on this new program?  Let us know in the comments below!', user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'Career Comparison Shopping With Locum Tenens Positions', body: 'Today we have a guest post about locum tenens positions submitted to us by Adam Ghosh. This is very valuable information to keep in mind about your future career and how to decide what job situation is right for you.

Adam Ghosh has over twenty years’ experience as a researcher in the medical field. In that time he has worked with allergists and vascular surgeons, and everyone in between. Now he supplements his early retirement by contributing to Weatherby Healthcare.

One of the most valuable experiential byproducts to be gleaned from attending med school and a residency tour (or tours) is determining the professional preferences of an aspiring medical professional. I don’t know how many times I’ve encountered a student (or former student) whose original career path-plan or specialty practice-preference changed based on a class they took or time spent as a resident. Finding out what works for you and what you enjoy is obviously a huge part of the process, but discerning what you don’t like is at least as important. Once the practice particulars have been sorted an equally important and far longer term decision awaits- where do you want to settle and into what sort of practice?

Often, realizations and conclusions about specialization, location and position are settled by factors that never would have occurred to someone before school or residency. One friend of mine was dead set on becoming a rural pediatrician until the studying she did for an obstetrics and gynecology course (which she found fascinating despite having never considered it beforehand) introduced her to OB/GYN politics, history and culture, which she found undeniable. Another friend’s discovery of true crime paperbacks in med school led him to pathology.

Similarly, I’ve had colleagues that swore off their rural practice because of the travel, isolation and commute. I know several that loved working in the ER during residency but found the hospital politics unpalatable once they were officially employed. There are any number of additional examples I can cite but no need to belabor the point: there’s no teacher like experience and before you choose your hospital/clinic/private practice as a GP/podiatrist/neurosurgeon in the urban/rural/suburban north/south/east/west, it’s never a bad idea to test drive it.

A great tool for doing so is taking locum tenens contracts in or near places that appeal in the employment situation you’re considering (maybe more than one of them, if possible)- hospital, big/small; clinic, public/private; practice, urban/rural, etc. Tenure as a locum tenens provides a real-time window to your future somewhere. Often a wider window than is granted by visiting a place is all-important. If you’re dreaming of a job in tropical Hawaii or the beautiful, verdant Pacific Northwest, living and working there for a year is going to be a substantially better litmus test for your patience with year-round heat and very expensive dairy products or six months of rain (all of which, oddly, appeals to me; I’m lactose intolerant).

And that week-long jaunt to New York during which you fell in love with the Big Apple may not accurately reflect your relationship after a year of subway commuting and your $1800-a-month closet-sized studio apartment. (Then again, it might prove a perfect reflection.)

Perhaps your love of skiing brought you to rural Idaho. Better to find out before you settle down that your fervently liberal politics prove a poor fit with the Gem State. (Or that your Fox News bumper sticker wins you no friends in San Francisco.) As briefly mentioned- the same goes for your place of employment. Even if you are a committed hospitalist, the culture, politics, management and care style, focus and atmosphere can obviously vary significantly. Your experience at an urban hospital in Boston is going to contrast considerably with an experience at an urban hospital in Los Angeles, much less a small, rural hospital in Mississippi.

The locum tenens dynamic is, in my opinion, underutilized. Particularly for someone considering more than one location or employer, working as a locum tenens is almost always an effective means of establishing a preference. If you’re recently out of school or otherwise in a position to do so- look into some locum tenens positions. Chances are you won’t regret it.', user_id:1)

Post.create(title: 'A Window Into The Life Of A Traveling Clinical Psychologist', body: 'Today we have a guest post from Vance Hobbes, a freelance writer and former medical researcher about the life of a traveling clinical psychologist.

I was a clinical psychologist for 21 years, and was fortunate enough to travel to some very unique places around the world. I mainly worked with unfortunate children, whether that because of recent turmoil within their home country or trouble at home, each of my cases contributed to an overall better understanding of how various minds and social groups function within specific circumstances. I’ll do my best to cover my first situation in a concise and reader-friendly manner, but honestly I find it difficult not including each and every detail over that period, but perhaps an autobiography will be in the works someday to accomplish that goal. So, here goes.

In 1990 I received my graduate degree from University of Nevada (Reno), and was honestly burnt out from spending most of my life buried in books and taking study breaks at local coffee shops. So, I figured I’d take a couple years off before finding work as I was able to make minimum student loan payments at relatively low interest rates. So I thought, ‘hmm what to do to reward myself?’ So I set up a trip to Sri Lanka as because I met a couple of my really good friends at school from there. Five weeks prior to my trip, I get a call from a group looking for some young people to travel to a place called Lebanon which was recovering from a recent civil war. The UN had contacted this company and called the situation in dire need of psychological assistance, not only was the national government in need of reparations but the various local populations were in the process of recovering as well. I hadn’t really ever thought of my job as an international duty, but I thought, ‘what a great opportunity to travel as well as practice what I had been training years for.’ My Sri Lankan buddies were pretty bummed, but to get paid to travel was not something I was about to pass up.

When I landed in Lebanon, I honestly had no idea what to expect. The place was a mess, but I was surprised to learn only around 17,000 Lebanese casualties (not including civilian) had resulted from the conflict. I understood it had just been involved in an 8-year civil war, but had no idea this would constitute the aftermath. My duty was to reach out to children with broken families, orphans, and those injured from the tools of war. Those first few weeks were extremely difficult for me to cope with. I’ve never been an emotional person, but those first weeks were the most sobering and grim of my entire life. One of my kids had lost his eye and could barely see out his other due to a munitions blast that had killed his brother and left Ruri severely burned. When treating him, I would rarely get a dozen words out of him per week, so advised him to either nod or shake his head to answer my questions. Over time he started to feel more comfortable with me, and the sorrow from losing a family member thawed away and melted into guilt-trip for not protecting his younger brother. This was difficult for him but a common thought process and easy to diagnose. It’s been years since I’ve spoken to Ruri but when I left in 1993 he was working and had met a very pretty girl of which he spent much of his time with.

I also spent time at a child daycare just outside Beirut and essentially gave my time to supervise the children living there. Indirectly, I helped various children who had suffered from social and familial disturbances through simple conversational means. For example I met a little 9-year old who went by the name of Mahmoud who hadn’t been directly affected by the war but knew quite a few friends who had lost someone or had lost their homes amidst the conflict. He could not come to terms with why it seemed as if everyone but him had something bad happen to them. It was definitely difficult connecting with the boy as a foreigner who had not experienced the war and the hell it brought. Because I had lost one of my parents while relatively young, I was able to use my experience as an inlet and convince the boy how fortunate he truly was to be unaffected by the terrible situation of war. His parents had been working in northern Lebanon (Tripoli) for a few months but remained in regular contact with their son. It was at this point in time when I had a much greater appreciation for any familial relationship and dearly missed my own back in the states. My assignment would end around eight months later, so my grief soon ended and I returned home.

Although my trip to Lebanon only identifies one of my many traveling psychologist assignments, the lessons learned through that trip were applied to subsequent travels I partook in. Understanding each child’s unique circumstances allowed me to approach each situation from a different perspective. I was able to diagnose, treat, and largely ease a child’s pain based upon what I had studied in school and through my experiences with other individuals I had either interned with or came across during my lifetime. In conclusion, the world of the traveling psychologist can be scary at times. Meeting kids like Ruri and Mahmoud and helping them deal with psychological and emotional distress has by far brought me the most satisfaction. I feel like the luckiest man in the world to have had these experiences, and would be happy to speak with any student looking to be a traveling psychologist or who has pondered the prospect prior.

Post.create(title: '5 Steps Crucial To Get Into Medical School', body: 'Today we have a guest post from Joe Baxter on the crucial steps to getting into medical school. Enjoy!

Joe Baxter worked in medical research for the majority of his life. In his spare time, he enjoys traveling abroad, working in his wood shop and freelance writing about medical news.

You can read all the stories you want about preparing for Medical school, but each person’s experience is a little different. It’s difficult to prepare for, stressful, and once finished you probably question if it was worth all that time and effort seemingly chucked out the window. But it is worth it. If you truly are committed to studying medicine, it’s worth every minute of your time taken. Bestowed upon you is the right to decide whether a medical action is reasonable, comfortable, invasive or painful. I don’t need to tell you that the world of medicine is saturated with conflicting and controversial decisions. But if you are desirous to answer yes, then here are a few of my steps which helped me get into Medical school.

Know your decision. If you are dead-set on becoming a family health physician or within another realm of medicine, you have already known for a while. You can’t just one day obtain an epiphany from some higher power telling you to go to Medical school because you made the grades in high school and college. It is completely your decision to determine if this is right for you. Med school is an enormous step, so know exactly what you’re getting into before making the jump. Know how Medical school works, the schools you apply to, and what these next eight years will entail.
Apply early. You hear it quite a bit, but waiting a few days instead of filling out apps or waiting until the next scheduled MCAT can cost you an additional year of living out of your parents’ garage.
Volunteer. It doesn’t matter if you spend two hours a week scrubbing the backsides of residents at a retirement home, because it’s something to throw on your Medical school resume showing you were at least active, involved, and willing to start at the bottom. Med school committees want to see if you are in this for the long haul. It’s those little jobs that separate you from all those other applicants. After all, they want to know not only if you are committed to make it through eight years of additional schooling, but also if they can trust you to hold people’s lives in your hands after the education. If you can’t handle those unglamorous jobs now, you won’t be committed later. Get out, intern, and give away your time.
Communication. Write, talk, talk, and write some more. Practice this. A hefty portion dictating whether you get into Med school depends on how well you come across to interviewers and the review committees. Your written statement(s), interview skills, and overall ability to speak clearly, concisely, and thoughtfully give those reviewing your entrance request a great picture of how prepared you are. Grab your intern adviser, a professor, or even your sister and practice interviewing in front of them. Wear the exact same clothing, hairstyle, and dress jacket you would wear to the interview. Make great eye contact, carefully listen to each posed question, and answer uniquely and truthfully.
Your answers before their questions. This is a tangent from #4, but ensure you are prepared to answer any and all questions the committee can throw at you. Obviously, you’ll want to know how to answer, “why do you want to become a doctor,” “why is this Medical school right for you,” and “tell me about this C in organic chemistry.” But be prepared for the questions that can catch you off-guard. Questions such as motivational tools you put use to, how do you handle stress, or should doctors be allowed withdraw life support from terminally-ill patients. Many of the questions that stump interviewees are those which may catch an applicant completely off-guard and force them to begin stuttering like a bumbling fool. Preparedness is not something that comes overnight, so begin practicing months ahead of time.', user_id:1)

If you are interested in becoming a travel nurse, take advantage of her wise insights regarding the nursing profession.

What Can Nursing Schools Do To Attract More Men?

In today’s society, there are still job-related stereotypes that remain from decades past. For example, only men were mechanics in the past. However, many women are entering the field today. The opposite applies for nursing. While this job was viewed as a woman’s work in decades past, more and more men are joining the ranks today. Nursing is a field that is constantly growing in complexity and tasks. As today’s society continues to equalize in jobs and in other ways, expect to see more male nurses. There are plenty of benefits to having men in the nursing profession. Some of these include the following:

Men generally have good physical strength, which enables them to do heavy lifting.
It is common for many difficult female patients to cooperate better with male nurses.
Male patients who do not want female nurses helping them with private care will appreciate male nurses.
Since female nurses do not want men to outshine them, having male nurses on staff can provide healthy and friendly competition for everyone to perform at their best.
It is a common occurrence that having one or more men on staff cuts down on gossip and cattiness in the workplace.
Male nurses tend to be passionate about what they do, so they often encourage patients, visitors and coworkers without even trying.

Attracting Men to the Nursing Profession

With all of the great benefits associated with having male nurses on staff, it is important for both schools and employers to encourage men to enter the field. Male nurses only make up approximately five percent of the workforce in the nursing profession. To appeal to men, it is important to find the aspects of nursing that would make them want to consider joining. The following are some good ways educational institutions can attract more male nursing students:

Dispel the stereotype that nursing is a profession for women.
Stress the complex technological aspects of various specialties.
List the wide range of specialty areas that might appeal more to men. For example, cardiology would likely be more attractive to them than labor and delivery.
Stress that nursing is much more than bedside care and bathing.
List some examples of how men can advance and promote in nursing careers.
Suggest some adventurous and exciting opportunities such as travel nursing.
Men are practical creatures, so emphasize the long-term stability of nursing careers, good pay and attractive benefits.
If program guides include stock photos of nursing professionals, be sure to include pictures with male nurses.
Whenever possible, have male recruiters meet with prospective male students.
Make sure men who are enrolled know they have a solid support system to avoid having them drop out or change majors.


In addition to emphasizing these important points, nursing schools and program directors should consider raising the bar on their entrance requirements. Men naturally enjoy competition and challenges, so they are not as likely to be attracted to a program that is extremely easy to enter. If the requirements are stricter, they may find the challenge more attractive. Some schools saw not only the number of applicants rise after doing this but also the number of applications from men.

Fortunately, more men have been entering the field since the recession in the late 2000s. Many schools will still need to put forth some extra effort to see the number of their male nursing students rise. Reaching out to hospitals and nursing homes by encouraging them to add tuition reimbursement or other benefits is a good way for schools to attract more male students. Program directors should encourage administrators in these facilities to reach out to current male employees in other departments that pay less. If they are presented with an attractive opportunity to learn for an affordable cost but also receive better pay and benefits in the future, many are likely to be enticed enough to jump on the offer. Social media, newsletters and other correspondence that is available to the public can also be helpful. If every school puts forth the effort, more men will likely enter the field and add their valuable contributions to the many positive contributions women are currently providing.

Post.create(title: 'Writing Tips For Medical School Admission Essays', body: 'Byline: Alex is a student, writer and a blogger. He can help you to write an admission essay. Follow him on twitter @AlexPetryck.

Admission essays are very much important to the school you are applying. Their significance might not seem very huge but they count when you want to be accepted at a specific university. Students tend to complicate their admission essays since, first they’re not aware of who will read their essays and second, because they don’t know how the readers want them. Nevertheless, you should avoid all that panic about what’s unknown and write your story-plain simple. Keep it interesting, and most important, write the truth.

Your admissions essay should be able to pass a message to the admissions committee of the school you’re applying to. While Medicine is not a common or a mere ordinary course for everyone, when you’re writing an admission essay for a course to study it, you have to showcase intelligent and a calling.

In writing your admissions essay therefore, put on paper why you are suitable for this course and how you intend to grow yourself with the help of the medical community from the school. Probably be creative and twist your reasons of wanting to join their medical school and some day become a doctor or a neurologist. Every admissions board loves to read something unique because similar reasons written by every applicant to their course tends to be boring. It helps if you go into the essays writing process, knowing this.

The only thing to save the committee from dozing off while reading your piece is to awaken them with an outstanding admissions essay. Write an essay that complements all the experiences you’ve had since childhood- for instance if you ever cleaned out wounds as a child or participated as a first aid attendant in high school etc., writing from real life desirable experience will boost your appeal.

Tips to writing an acceptable medical admissions essay

Answer the essay question

It is very easy to write irrelevant information in your medical admissions essay. Some students will write everything not related to the medical field, which is the only important thing for the admission board. When you are given a certain essay question, analyze it correctly and at no stage should you forget you’re applying to med school. What is important to them is your experience to do with medicine as a career and why the developing a career dream through them is your primary goal.

Write your story

Do not try to copy someone else story to portray yourself as the best suited to get a chance at joining the medical school. You are supposed to be writing about your personal history; you must have one that would make your gut want to go to med school. Make it even more interesting by adding instances where you have had to take care of the sick in your community and all will be perfect.

Grammar and spelling errors

Even though you have written your admissions essay perfect simple spelling and grammatical mistakes may let you down. The admissions committee member is also keen to recruit an all-round student. Check your sentences and paragraphs to make sure they’re not too lengthy. Write short, valuable and interesting sentences. Use active voice as much as possible and make sure your paragraphs flow from one to the other seamlessly.

Read to a few friends to get their view

Sharing out your writing with friends will help to give you feedback on what you should improve. They might help you to reanalyze your answers and make them more interesting or unique. Moreover, they can give you their contributions on unique personal experiences to help you connect your personality much better.

Revise your admissions essay

With the feedback you receive from your friends, add new ideas to modify your essay. Additionally get rid of simple mistakes that were invisible to your eyes.  Read aloud several times to ensure your admission essay flows to the conclusion part before submitting it.

Post.create(title: 'Direct BSMD From High School To Medical School Sign Me Up', body: 'There are thousands of pre-medical students that apply for medical school each year, and only a slim percentage gain admission. It’s distressing that students who have dreamed of becoming a physician all of their lives simply cannot because their application to medical school was poor. They spend years retaking the MCAT and reapplying, cycle after cycle, only to continuously get rejected by medical schools. What if there was a way to guarantee one’s spot in medical school early on? I’m talking about as early as high school. Well, there is – and not many people know about it.

Such programs hold many names, ranging from “direct BS/MD” to “guaranteed admissions.” Once one gains admission into this program in their senior year in high school, they go on to spend a few years in a specific undergraduate university, then four years in medical school. There are accelerated programs, which are either 6 or 7 years right out of high school, or the non-accelerated ones which are 8 years.

These combined medical programs (yet another name) have different requirements (depending on the school) that must be met to keep one’s status as direct BS/MD student. Some programs require a minimum score on the MCAT while others waive it altogether. They typically require a minimum GPA to be met throughout one’s undergraduate career, and perhaps require one to attain a certain number of volunteer hours or take a specific set of courses. Regardless, once these criteria are met, the student has a seat in medical school with their name on it. These programs require students to apply in their senior year, during the typical admissions cycle in high school. There are upwards of 65 such programs offered across the country, yet they are not advertised as brightly as they should be.

Even earlier than the application cycle, and definitely more important, is the preparation period. A potential applicant must spend hundreds of hours volunteering at a hospital and must have the very best grades and standardized exam scores. They should also present various shadowing and research experiences to show they have seen and interacted closely with the medical profession, and to show they have gone above and beyond most high school students. This paired with excellent recommendation letters, well-written essays, and a great interview will almost guarantee a student admission into one of these programs. From high school, the applicant must know they want to pursue a career in medicine, and must convey that throughout their application cycle.

Getting accepted into a medical school in high school is probably one of the most beneficial things a student interested in medicine can do. It saves you the headache you’ll encounter applying to medical school later on. In addition, you’ll have to work twice as hard distinguishing yourself as an undergrad than when you are in high school.

Post.create(title: 'Nursing As A Second Career', body: 'In today’s world, nursing school is not just for people in their 20’s. Some people choose to enter a nursing program even after retirement. There is no wrong age to enter the field, and students who are older than their peers should not feel intimidated. Older students actually have some very valuable advantages over their younger peers.



Years of Hands-on Experience: Many younger nursing students enroll in programs immediately after graduating high school. However, older students often enter the field after they have raised their children and have also sent them away to college. Some students may have taken care of an elderly or disabled family member at home.


While the technological aspects of a nursing program may seem intimidating, older students often have the upper hand on their younger counterparts when it comes to practical care-giving experience. In a story published by Scrubs Magazine, a former Buddhist priest became a nurse after the age of 50. The man gained an interest in the field after his experience of caring for an ill teacher.



More Confident: Regardless of age, every student will question his or her ability to succeed at some point. This is normal. However, younger students have not had the same life experiences that older students have experienced. For this reason, they are not always able to realistically gauge their abilities. Some may spend too much time socializing. Others may not have been exposed to difficult real-life situations or may drop out.


When older nurses enter the profession, they usually have strong reasons that motivated them to choose that specific field. By the time they enroll, they have also developed confidence in their own abilities. This means that they know their strengths, weaknesses and limits. Older students may still fall under the criticism of seasoned professionals in training. However, they have had enough life experiences to know that they should not take criticism personally. Some younger people may be more emotional and make rash decisions about halting their career when they encounter repetitive criticism.



More disciplined: Rasmussen College outlines this important point. Since older students have had a great deal of life experience, they have learned how to prioritize their time. They have also learned what motivates them and how to stay focused. Perhaps they learned by caring for others, traveling or just paying their own living expenses. Older students tend to avoid the party scene and nightlife that is common with younger students, so they usually find more time to study and absorb important information.
The unique experiences that students who are seasoned in life bring to the classroom do not only benefit them personally. By exercising their leadership capabilities, older nursing students can help motivate and educate younger students. They can teach them how to prioritize their tasks, motivate themselves and recognize the reality of caring for other human beings. Seasoned students can teach their younger peers a greater appreciation and value for life.

While dosage calculations and medical terminology are essential for performing the functions of many nursing jobs correctly, lessons learned from life experiences are even more valuable for the emotional and mental aspects of all nursing jobs. According to Heritage Newspaper, some of the best nursing program directors are more concerned about an applicant’s passion and bedside manners during an admission evaluation. For readers who still feel skeptical about the challenges of learning new technology, keep in mind that younger students will likely share their tech knowledge in exchange for some sensible information that will last them a lifetime.

The main purpose of going to college is getting a quality education (well, at least for most students), but the things students learn during that period of life extend beyond the lectures they hear in class. College is all about learning how to become responsible and manage to live on your own without asking for more money from your parents. Becoming self-sufficient is not an easy process, but it can be made easier if you follow the right guidelines. This article will provide you with tips on how to spend (and save) your money in a smart way.

1. Save on living expenses!

Now that you are living away from your parents, the bills will be on your back; and that’s not an easy burden to deal with. If you never had to pay an electricity bill, the monthly expenses for this purpose may come as a shock to you. You can reduce the electricity usage by using energy efficient bulbs and turning off the lights when you don’t need them. Learning how to use electricity wisely is a small step that will bring you significant savings, and it’s a lesson for life!

Another significant living expense is decorating. Here’s where things get fun, as decorating on a budget is even more pleasurable than being able to spend money on whatever you lay your eyes upon. There are many objects that can be repurposed and used as multifunctional items. Don’t be shy from getting the most of thrift stores, as they hide real gems of lovely furniture pieces that you can bring back to life. Being creative definitely pays out!

2. Be smart with your insurance choices!

Car insurance is constantly getting more expensive, but you can still achieve a better price if you play the right cards. The first thing you should do is check whether your car is worth for comprehensive insurance or not. Besides searching for the best insurance offers online, you should also ask your insurance company about your rights to discount, because the best offers are often not being marketed. You can reduce the amount you pay on insurance by combining policies, annual mileage and good grades.

3. Learn how to save on food!

Coupons are students’ best friends! It is best to do your weekly food shopping with beneficial coupons, but make sure that the coupon is really valuable (it would mean nothing to you if you were purchasing the items in an expensive store). You have to do a price comparison between different stores, because it is pointless to pay more if you can get the same things for a lower price.

Learning how to cook is inevitable in college. You cannot rely solely on fast food, as that would not only bring you health consequences, but it would also be devastating to your budget. It is very easy to cook cheap, simple and highly nutritious meals. Trust me; as soon as you start cooking and experimenting with different ingredients, you will start loving the kitchen!

Remember: if you want to save money on food, it is recommended to stick to the foods that belong to the lower levels of the food pyramid.

4. Learn all about taxation!

Qualifying for larger returns is a clever way of refreshing your budget. If you just got your first job, you should research the Internet for practical tips on tax planning in order to get the most out of the money you make. If you know nothing about taxes and all those rules confuse you, the best recommendation is to work with a tax service, as it can really help you get qualified for bigger returns.

5. Have fun, but stay within the limits!

Students in college would have limitless fun if they weren’t limited by their budgets. In fact, being limited with money is a good thing because it keeps you reasonable and responsible. You can still have fun without spending too much money – all you need are good friends, great music and cheerful spirit. When it comes to good music, iTunes is not your only source, you know. There are lovely coffee shops with great live music that’s free and much better.

You don’t have to go to bars and clubs each weekend in order to enjoy your free time. Sure, clubs are a great place for meeting new people, but such a night out always costs you a lot of money. Moreover, staying on campus and enjoying the company of your friends can bring all of you closer, because there is nothing natural about the contact you make in clubs.

Conclusion: It’s not difficult to live within the limits

Being short on money is never pleasant, but you can learn how to manage the situation as soon as you get into the habit of spending your money wisely. Remember to stay organized, keep track of your income and expenses and take the necessary measures if you can’t reach a positive balance in the end of the month (yes, I’m trying to tell you to get a job).', user_id:1)
